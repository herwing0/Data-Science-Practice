       "[b\"in arguably the most anticipated movie this century , george lucas has achieved a very mixed reaction to a sure blockbuster . \\ndespite the fact the script and plot is a bit of a let down , the entire movie on the whole can be considered a milestone in technical excellence , in the sound and special effects department . \\nin terms of characters , by far the most outstanding and interesting is queen amidala ( natalie portman ) , whose mature performance far exceeds her tender 14 years of age . \\nshe is one ? hot' babe who defines true ? woman leadership' . \\nshe not only has a presence , but knows how to take command of the situation and save her planet from ruination . \\nno thanks to the jedi knights who although led by the force , lack leadership qualities in terms of thinking up a plan to do anything . \\nthe young obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) who has a bad hair day in every scene , gets to kill a bad guy in the end , but lacks a love interest to make him a desirable sort of hero . \\nin fact all the jedi knight are a bit asexual - there must be something about the force which makes them all hermits and loners . \\ni mean it would be interesting to see yoda's girlfriend for a change , if he has one . \\nnot much better is qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) who mostly broods , and has a better hair do than obi-wan , but only to find the young anakin skywalker and make the biggest mistake of his life . \\nalso fascinating is george lucas ? metoclorian' theory , which claims that micro-organisms live within our cells and tie us to the fabric of the universe . \\nand it is the high concentrations of these organisms in an individual which make them particularly powerful in the force . \\nmore humerous are the claims to the immaculate conception of darth vader , no doubt a concept stolen from the christian faith , except there will be no christmas to celebrate the birth of this dark emissary of the force . \\noverall an experience which is not to be missed because of the very fact that it's predecessor almost command a viewing of this inferior successor . \\nby all means not the pinnacle of the star wars phenomena but an adequate addition to the clan . \\nwatch out for the next one , it should be one steamy encounter between queen amidala and anakin skywalker - who i believe should be portrayed by ? leonardo di caprio . \\n\",\n",
       " b' \" when will the devil take me ? \" he asks rhetorically in lulling voice over . \\nthe spoiled title character of _onegin_ ( pronounced oh-negg-in ) is waiting on death to relieve him after a lifetime of rapacious behaviour . \\nmartha fiennes\\' debut feature is ( quite literally ) filmed poetry ( it\\'s based on an epic russian poem by alexander pushkin ) , a profound study of regret , of how we confuse shame with guilt . \\nwhen we first meet eugene onegin ( ralph , acting for his sister ; another brother , magnus , composed the score ) , a philandering aristocrat from st . petersburg , he has just inherited his uncle\\'s estate . \\nwith plans to sell it , onegin pays a summer visit to the manor , which is located in an underpopulated russian countryside , and not long into the trip he meets a neighbouring family of blue bloods . \\nsmitten with olga larina ( headey ) , he befriends olga\\'s fianc ? , vladimir lensky ( stephens ) , while olga\\'s sister , tatyana ( tyler ) , romanticizing his flippant attitude ( he\\'s a nineteenth bad boy ) , falls for onegin . \\nin one sweaty , inky torrent of passion , tatyana writes him a love letter . \\nhe is at least intrigued by the note but rejects her affections , it is implied , because he can . \\nsoon after , tragedy strikes , and onegin makes himself scarce . \\nwhen we catch up with him , six years later , he has just returned to st . petersburg , where at a grand ball he discovers that an old friend ( donovan ) has married a more womanly and wordly tatyana . \\nthis time , onegin finds her irresistable . \\nwhat is most amazing about ralph fiennes\\' performance is his subtle physical transformation from dashing snob to miserly grouch . \\noverwhelmed by a top hat , the onegin who pines for tatyana seems smaller in stature than the one who brushed her off , an ebeneezer scrooge trapped in christmas past . \\nthe actor has been constricted playing heroes for too long now-there\\'s room to breathe in a role that\\'s made up of shades of gray like \" onegin \" . \\npetula clark sang of a universal phenomenon in \" parking lot \" : \" you don\\'t know what you\\'ve got ? til it\\'s gone . \" \\nonegin\\'s about-face on tatyana speaks for those of us ( read : most of us ) who need confirmation that someone or something is wanted by others before we want it as well . \\nwhat the character feels is not jealousy but remorse , embarrassment , even , at having let her go . \\nout of identification we feel empathy for onegin , a callous bastard . \\ntatyana\\'s emotions echo a thousand ditties , but that makes them no less vital . \\nshe changes , too , from a girl in crush to a woman with divided loyalties . \\ntyler acquits herself surprisingly well among her uk co-stars , filling in sketchy gaps by expressing base sentiments in a series of wanton stares . \\nthey both have faces , mr . fiennes and ms . tyler , capable of conveying archetypal russian misery . \\n_onegin_ could have added up to little more than a distinguished episode of \" masterpiece theater \" , even with its current cast of thoroughbreds intact , were martha fiennes not at the helm . \\nan mtv background ( she cut her teeth directing rock videos for xtc and others ) has positively influenced her sense of pace ( though , thankfully , not her shot lengths-no spasmodic cutting here ) ; at just over 100 minutes , _onegin_ clicks along like a brisk walk through valleys of despair . \\nthe film has an atypical period look , as well . \\nabsent are the sumptuous tableware and antique furnishings that stand in for plot and character in those drippy merchant ivory productions . \\nthe sets are almost expressionistically bare , echoing the loneliness of the protagonists . \\n ( cinematographer remi adafarasin often allows space to engulf them ; i\\'m reminded the climax , which unfolds in a sea of white . ) \\nmartha fiennes has a clear command of cinema , and her spare , often painfully human visual presentation of \" yevgeny onegin \" is arguably the most lucid translation of pushkin\\'s difficult text yet . \\nms . fiennes may be the most exciting female presence behind a camera since jane campion . \\n',\n",
       " b'here is a movie that sadly follows the hong kong-recipe of moviemaking and storytelling to the letter . \\nthese kinds of movies are marked by an eye-opening sequence that introduces us to the main characters ; a life-and-death plot in which these characters become involved ; the inclusion of a host of inconsequential characters ; ridiculous subplots , and sunglass-wearing henchmen . \\nthat is not to say that i don\\'t like hong kong influenced movies ; however , it is quite obvious that these moviemakers haven\\'t a clue that the american filmgoer needs more than hip-hop-talking thugs and stupid sight gags . \\nobserve the opening sequence . \\na band of hitmen are about to storm an apartment , led by melvin ( mark wahlberg ) and cisco ( lou diamond phillips ) . \\nthey are waiting for their partner to cut off the power so that they can storm the apartment with the help of infrared goggles . \\nhowever , their partner is unsure of which cable to cut . \\nhe is undecided . \\nthis happens for about 10 seconds . \\nthe audience finds some humor in his foolishness . \\nthe lights suddenly go out . \\ncisco is surprised and says : \" whoa . . . let\\'s \\ngo ! \" \\nand they storm the apartment in a very nicely executed sequence . \\nthe big hit of the title refers to a kidnapping that happens a quarter of the way through the film . \\nneeding cash , cisco devises a plan to kidnap the daughter ( china chow ) of wealthy japanese industrialist jiro nishi . \\nhowever , the daughter is also the god-daughter of paris ( avery brooks ) , who is cisco\\'s and melvin\\'s boss . \\ninfuriated and insufferable , paris commands cisco to uncover the mastermind of the kidnapping . \\nduring his \\'investigation\\' , cisco singles out melvin as the ringleader , and paris orders his capture and execution . \\nmelvin must now find a way to stay alive . \\nby the way , do you know how the investigation takes place ? \\ncisco\\'s partner makes the ransom phone call believing that his call will not be traced because of a trace buster that prevents tracing . \\nbut , mr . nishi has a trace buster buster . \\nto counter that , cisco\\'s partner has a trace buster buster buster . \\nbut nishi has a trace buster buster buster buster . \\nand so on . . . \\nthere is no doubt that this is an interesting world in which they live . \\nand there are lots of issues that we\\'d like to know more about . \\nhow does melvin justify his profession to his fiancee ? \\nwhat goes on among this clique ? \\nwhy is cisco at odds with melvin ? \\nthere is actually a lot of potential material that could have been explored , but it seems that no effort is made to go in that direction , and instead we are given a not-so-engrossing plot filled with one-liners , silly sight gags , extraneous sub-plots and tomfoolery . \\nand , i haven\\'t even mentioned his financee\\'s visiting parents who want them to separate , nor melvin\\'s mistress , nor the pimple-faced video clerk demanding the return of an overdue video and on and on and on . \\nif the big hit signals the future of hong kong style movies that are made for american audiences , then shoot me now . \\n',\n",

       " b'when i ponder childhood memories past , one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the \" inspector gadget \" tv show with my older brother . \\ntruth be told , we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune , alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw , the inspector\\'s arch nemesis . \\ni was never a biggie on nostalgia , but you just can\\'t help but have fond memories of something like that . \\nsometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes , trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid . \\nat the very least , i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me . \\ndespite how horrid a film may be , the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up . \\nso back i sat , with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( let\\'s face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) . \\ni was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations ) , and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well . \\nrarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness . \\nas everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind , i was left sitting there , absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen . \\ncan something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ? \\nright from the beginning , i knew i was in trouble . \\nin the opening scenes , each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be , to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones . \\nwhen referring to them , people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be ( \" oh , hi penny ! \\nis brain with you ? \" ) . \\ncreating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another . \\nthe \" plot \" , shall we call it , stays fairly in tune with the original series . \\nmatthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? ) , \\na security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why , rupert everett , for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! ) , who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events . \\nbrown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein he\\'s joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll , please ) . . . \\ninspector gadget ! \\n>from here on out , the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although , to be fair , my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) . \\nthere\\'s something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillon\\'s dentures from there\\'s something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself . \\nto be honest , i wasn\\'t much paying attention to these \" treats \" . \\ni was just glad that it was over . \\n',\n",
       " b'this is the worst movie i\\'ve seen since the \" so bad i walked out on it \" \" jingle all the way \" . \\nit is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap . \\nit is crap through and through . \\nnothing works in this film , as to be expected from joel schumacher , who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being \" cousins \" ) . \\nhere\\'s a man who admits he\\'s a medicore director , a rather charmingly self-effacing statement . \\nbut truth be told , he is much worse than mediocre . \\nnot all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again . \\nthere is no plot anywhere , and the \" dialogue \" is unrelentingly shallow , preposterous , and boring . \\nthey set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife , then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners . \\nit turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death . \\nbut that\\'s par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense , including half of arnold schwarzenegger\\'s lines . \\nas mr . freeze , arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once . \\nthis is the same problem he had in \" jingle all the way \" , and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass . \\npersonally , i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesn\\'t retake scenes to make him understandable . \\ncompare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in \" batman & robin \" . \\napparently , james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold . \\numa thurman is not as bad , but nothing resembling good either . \\nher poison ivy vamps around terribly , chewing up scenery left and right . \\nand her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard \" acting \" , as if she\\'s reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment . \\ngiven the \" script \" , it\\'s a wonder it didn\\'t happen more frequently . \\nthere is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman , chris o\\'donnell as robin , nor alicia silverstone as batgirl . \\nmichael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred , as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance . \\nin fact , there was something unsettling about his appearance , which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks , looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man . \\nunfortunately , every scene about alfred\\'s sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions , losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart . \\nthe movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know there\\'s a bunch of people , but instead of a melee , schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist . \\nthere\\'s never a moment of awe , wonder , or mayhem . \\nthe only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects , which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) . \\neven then , the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable . \\nthe hockey team from hell ? \\nnot even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that \" batman & robin \" showcases ) . \\nfrustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do . \\nblink , and you\\'ll miss elle macpherson as julie madison , vivica fox as a \" why is she even in the film \" vamp in freeze\\'s lair ( with all of two lines ) , and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had . \\nand in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs , vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isn\\'t even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me , she\\'s quite attractive outside of this dreck ) . \\nand as if the film weren\\'t bad enough to limp along with bad direction , bad dialogue , bad performances , and bad fight scenes , there are inconsistencies and illogic galore . \\ni know it\\'s nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs , why the character\\'s arms aren\\'t ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less ) , or where the moisture comes from when freeze\\'s weapon creates tons if ice . \\nthat\\'s all traditional comic book stuff . \\nbut why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ? \\nwhy is there a big switch clearly marked , \" heat \" in mr . freeze\\'s lair ? \\nwhy do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ? \\nwhy does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ?

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax\\'s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \\nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \\nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \\nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \\nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line\\'s a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \\nand scream\\'s rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \\nit\\'s hard to understate this last point . \\nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \\nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion\\'s share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2\\'s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film\\'s title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter\\'s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \\n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \\nand , much like mr . tarantino\\'s screenwriting , mr . williamson\\'s work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \\nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \\nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson\\'s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \\nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it\\'s only at about the film\\'s midway point when it becomes engaging . \\nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film\\'s principal narrative ; this time around , we\\'re following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \\nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i\\'ve ever seen ) . \\nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn\\'t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream\\'s ; while the first film\\'s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \\nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \\nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \\nthey\\'re joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \\nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn\\'t necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \\nthere\\'s a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney\\'s new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\\'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy\\'s fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale\\'s newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens\\' portia di rossi ) . \\nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \\nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \\none problem that scream didn\\'t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \\nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson\\'s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \\nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \\n ( it doesn\\'t help matters any that the killer\\'s alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \\nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \\nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \\nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it\\'s head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \\nthey\\'re staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \\nit\\'s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \\nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \\ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there\\'s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \\non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \\nshe doesn\\'t have any compelling presence , and there\\'s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she\\'s the returning heroine . \\ngiven this , and the fact that there\\'s no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal\\'s role isn\\'t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan\\'s shoes ) , it\\'s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \\nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \\nthe film\\'s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you\\'ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \\n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would\\'ve seemed obvious . ) \\nbut hey , as rose mcgowan\\'s character said in the first film : \" no , please don\\'t kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \\nlook what that got her . \\n',\n",

       " b'chris tucker is one of those guys you immediately get a reaction from -- you either find his helium voice , crazy eyes and jerky mannerisms funny or annoying . \\ni think i fall into the former category ( i\\'m one of the few who thought his turn in \" the fifth element \" as a prancing , prince-like deejay was complete inspired lunacy and not the least bit aggravating ) , but his new vehicle \" money talks \" just doesn\\'t do him service . \\ntucker is good in the movie -- and this is the kind of film that , if people see it , could make him a big star -- but he\\'s also really the only thing good about the movie . \\nin fact , if you see \" money talks , \" it should shock you beyond recognition that two of \" toy story \" \\'s writers penned the sloppy script . \\ntucker\\'s role here is that of franklin hatchett , a petty los angeles con artist whose carwash scams get him dogged by investigative reporter james russell ( charlie sheen ) . \\nafter being busted on the job for some illegal business involving counterfeit passports , franklin finds himself on a bus to the county jail and handcuffed to slick international jewel smuggler raymond villard ( gerard ismael ) . \\nbut villard\\'s thugs blow up the bus in an attempt to free their leader ( never mind that the explosion could have instead killed him ) , and because he and franklin are joined at the wrist , franklin is allowed to escape as well , but not before overhearing some important information regarding a diamond stash that -- for some reason or another -- is being hidden in a vintage roadster waiting to be auctioned off at an upcoming auto expo . \\nthe local media mistakenly puts the prison break-out blame on franklin , which is where james comes back into the picture . \\nhe makes a deal to protect franklin if , in turn , franklin gives him an exclusive interview . \\nthis means james must present his new \" friend \" in the stickiest of situations -- a formal dinner party for he and fiancee grace ( heather locklear ) , also attended by her uber-rich parents ( veronica cartwright and nicely game paul sorvino ) . \\nand of course the bad guys track franklin down and try to knock him off , all the while he spars and forms an unlikely bond with james . \\n \" this ain\\'t no buddy movie , \" claim the print ads . \\nyeah , right . \\nactually , for the better part of , oh , 20 minutes , it appears \" money talks \" has the momentum to cover entertaining ground , and this is mostly due to the presence of spastic motormouth tucker . \\nthis is tucker\\'s first leading role , and if you imagine a slightly lankier , african-american jim carrey with a reliance on wild r-rated raunch rather than pg-13 physical comedy , you have a good idea of the conviction with which he assaults the role . \\nbut you realize all too quickly that tucker\\'s overstated liveliness is the only thing \" money talks \" has going for it . \\nand a lively actor alone does not a successful movie make . \\nit\\'s all too easy to pick out everything wrong with \" money talks . \" \\nthe plot is recycled buddy-buddy comedy-thriller tripe that seemed overused even when \" nothing to lose \" employed it last month . \\neverything is paint-by-numbers , especially the los angeles coliseum finale , which finds not one , not two , but three separate enemy factions firing at franklin as they pursue him through the bleachers . \\nthe villains , as many as there are , are dull . \\ncertain story elements are too coincidental . \\nand too much of the film\\'s dramatic agenda is played too straight . \\na scene where grace confronts james after learning franklin\\'s true identity ( \" you brought a killer into my parents\\' house ! \" ) \\nis extremely silly . \\nyou get the picture . \\nobviously , i did not have a pleasant experience at \" money talks . \" \\nbut the people around me appeared to be having a rip-roaring good time ( one gentleman several rows behind me chortled with such expressive conviction i began fearing for his health ) . \\nbut tucker , at least for me , is a pretty funny guy , and aces the movie\\'s best scene , where franklin passes himself off as vic damone\\'s son at james and grace\\'s engagement bash and toasts the couple with barry white lyrics . \\ntucker\\'s audience -- and he does have one -- will probably like \" money talks . \" \\nthose who he irritates , however , will have a more productive day staying home and scraping the gook out from under their toenails . \\n',\n",

       " b'under any other circumstances , i would not be discussing the ending of a film to the extent that i will in this particular review . \\nhowever , in order to fully explain exactly how and why this movie is so awful , a minute dissection of the ending is necessary . \\neven though i will not reveal the details of the last scenes , do proceed at your own risk . \\nthe movie opens ( quite poorly , i might add ) as child psychologist malcolm crowe ( bruce willis , looking like he was dragged out of his trailer at the wee hours of the morning to shoot each scene ) and his wife are intruded upon by one of malcolm\\'s past patients . \\ndistraught , the suicidal man ( a cameo by new kid on the block donnie wahlberg ) shoots malcolm and then turns the gun on himself . \\ncut to the \" next fall \" , as we find the good doctor quietly observing his latest case , a trouble young man named cole ( haley joel osment , one of the only child actors in a while i didn\\'t want to bludgeoned over the head with a blunt instrument ) . \\nafter about 45 minutes of seemingly unrelated freak occurrences , we learn that cole has \" the sixth sense \" , the gift of being able to communicate with the dead . \\nand this , as they say , is where the healing begins . \\nthe sixth sense and its unexpected popularity is founded upon a twist ending that i knew going into the film ( one of roger ebert\\'s colleges was kind enough to give it away on a recent segment of \" siskel and ebert \" ) . \\nalthough i was at first enraged that an established film critic could so callously ruin a film for thousands of patrons , i soon realized that this turn of events could in fact have been a blessing in disguise ; i\\'ve always been a sucker for surprise endings ( my favorite movie is the usual suspects ) and rarely dislike a film that sports one . \\nhere , since i knew the major plot twist that was coming at the film\\'s conclusion , the possibly of being bamboozled into loving a bad movie solely because of its ending ( something i\\'ve fallen victim to in the past ) was eliminated . \\nand indeed , my viewing of the sixth sense did prove to be quite an enlightening experiment . \\nstripped of the element of surprise , the film was put to the task of showing what it really had , instead of simply hiding behind a shocking conclusion . \\nafter seeing its true colors , i came to the conclusion that the sixth sense is , despite what the many champions of the movie may say , void of any real power . \\nit\\'s a neat concept , but not one that justifies being made into a feature-length movie . \\nin fact , the sixth sense relies so strongly on its finale that the rest of the film develops as a sort of prelude to the supposedly earth-shattering revelation that is yet to come . \\nand when the final moments do come , it\\'s a huge letdown ; the end makes no sense at all . \\nit stupefied me with the heights of its ineptitude and is completely idiotic on a fundamental and very rare level . \\ni won\\'t go into any details , but suffice to say that , as far as i can tell , it negates to rest of the movie to such an extent that anyone who buys it even for a second must be suffering from a very acute case of attention deficit disorder . \\nnow , in all fairness , i cannot say for sure that i would have guessed the ending ( however stupid it may be ) had it not been revealed to me before hand . \\nhowever , i feel very confident that i , as well as anyone who had seen a few \" twilight zone \" episodes , would have seen it coming a mile away . \\nthe fact that movie-goers nation wide are surprised by the ending still has me stumped . \\nironically , to fully appreciate the best scene ( that of cole and malcolm attending a little girl\\'s funeral ) , the viewer is required to be aware of a very rare psychological disorder called munchausen syndrome by proxy . \\ni wouldn\\'t have even known about this mental disease if i hadn\\'t , by pure dumb luck , caught \" dateline nbc \" the other week when they did a feature story on it . \\ndespite being blessed with some really amazing cinematography and a brauva performance from osment ( where was this kid when casting calls were going out for the phantom menace ? ) , in the end , the sixth sense is too chalk-full of contradictions and just isn\\'t plausible enough to warrant even a slight recommendation . \\n',\n",

       " b'melvin van peebles\\' \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" was a watershed moment in the history of american cinema and the black movement . \\nit was released less than a decade after the civil rights movement had begun and almost twenty years before the rodney king incident . \\nits violent and highly sexualized revenge tale of a macho black hustler fighting back against white oppression and winning was something that had never been seen on an american movie screen before . \\nin style , content , and how it was conceived and produced , \" sweet sweetback \" was a cinematic revolution , whether or not one agrees with its subject matter . \\nvan peebles , a black american who first gained recognition by writing novels in france , built \" sweet sweetback \" from the ground up almost entirely by himself . \\nbecause no studio would dare fund such a film , he was forced to raise all the money himself . \\nthe movie ended up costing about $500 , 000 , part of which was put up by none other than bill cosby . \\nvan peebles cut costs by hiring non-union labor and taking on most of the film\\'s responsibilities himself . \\nhe wrote the script , scored the music , edited and directed the film , as well as starred in the central role . \\nhe was also a brilliant entrepreneur who always found a way to make an extra buck . \\nfor instance , when the mppa slapped the film with a dreaded x-rating , van peebles not only threatened to bring a lawsuit against jack valenti and the mpaa , but he also developed a little marketing scheme : he coined the phrases \" rated x by an all-white jury , \" which he put on the movie posters to help advertise the film . \\nhe also printed the phrase on tee-shirts which he had no problem selling . \\nthe storyline in \" sweet sweetback \" is deceptively simple . \\nit takes place in los angeles , and van peebles stars as the title character , a tough male hustler of few words who grew up in a brothel , and makes money by doing what he does best : having sex . \\none day , he agrees to go with a couple of amiable white cops down to the station to make it look like they\\'re bringing in suspects on a politically-charged case involving murder . \\nhowever , on the way to the station the cops arrest a young black revolutionary named mu-mu ( hubert scales ) , who they proceed to beat viciously . \\nacting out of complete impulse rather than political motivation , sweetback fights back and beats the cops to the brink of death . \\nthe rest of the film follows sweetback as he evades the cops on his way to eventual escape in mexico . \\nalthough the repetition of watching sweetback run gets a little old by the end of the film , this plot allows van peebles\\' camera to roam the darker side of l . a . - the ghettos , alleys , and back-street whorehouses that other films had always overlooked . \\nvan peebles\\' entire point in making the movie was to secure on celluloid a vision of the black experience in america that other filmmakers had ignored . \\nat the beginning of \" sweet sweetback , \" he offers this epigraph , which is a traditional prologue used in medieval times when a messenger brought bad news : \" sire , these lines are not an homage to brutality that the artist has invented , but a hymn from the mouth of reality . . . \" \\nvan peebles wanted to make sure that his vision was one of reality , not of exaggeration . \\nof course , with today\\'s abundance of rap and hip hop music that sings the same ode to black inner-city life , as well as films by spike lee , john singleton , and the hughes brothers , \" sweet sweetback \" doesn\\'t seem all that revolutionary . \\nit is important to remember that this film must be viewed in the context and time period in which it was made . \\nat that time , \" sweet sweetback \" was so controversial that only two theaters in the entire united states would play it . \\ndistributors were petrified of a film that , in van peebles\\' words , gave the black audience \" a chance to see some of their own fantasies acted out - about rising out of the mud and kicking ass . \" \\nof course , once it caught on , it caught on big . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is now considered to be the film that kicked off the blaxploitation era , although van peebles disassociates \" sweetback \" from other movies like \" shaft \" ( 1972 ) and \" the mack \" ( 1973 ) , because those were financed by big hollywood studios . \\n \" sweet sweetback \" is also the only film deemed mandatory viewing by the black panthers . \\nhowever , even if when viewed from an african-american perspective , \" sweet sweetback \" is certainly not without its controversies . \\nwhen it was first released , an article was published in \" ebony \" magazine denouncing the film , while at the same time the black panthers used an entire newsletter to praise it . \\nthere have been arguments that the victory for sweetback is really no victory at all - beating cops and then running away to mexico is nothing to be proud of . \\nothers have pointed out that sweetback has little to say throughout the film ; he has no political motivations , and therefore the violence and havoc he wreaks is not rooted in fundamental beliefs , but in personal and selfish motives . \\nstill others point to the clich ? black potency that stereotypes sweetback as being good at nothing but having sex , illustrated in a scene where he gains the respect of a white biker group by bringing their female leader to orgasm . \\nnevertheless , a movie like \" sweet sweetback \" cannot be made without conflicting points of view . \\nit is a revolutionary movie not because it\\'s about one man\\'s defiance , but because it put front-and-center black issues that had never been dealt with before . \\nuntil that point , american cinema was an almost exclusively white domain , and with the exception of sidney poitier , all black actors were relegated to specifically black roles that were important only in relation to whites . \\nthe fact that \" sweet sweetback \" was a movie by black about blacks , was something new ( in the opening credits , van peebles lists the starring actors as simply \" the black community \" ) . \\nvan peebles tells an interesting story that goes a long way toward defining the difference between \" sweet sweetback \" and all movies that had come before it . \\nwhen the movie first opened , he saw it in a theater next to an older woman . \\nnear the end of the film , when sweetback is wounded by the police and stumbling through the southern california desert , she kept saying to herself , \" oh lord , let him die . \\ndon\\'t let them kill him . \\nlet him die on his own . \" \\nit was so ingrained in her mind that death was imminent for any african-american in a movie who rebelled against white authority , that she couldn\\'t even conceive of the possibility that the film might end with his successful escape . \\nand , of course , sweetback does escape , and the screen fills with the message : \" watch out ! \\na baad asssss nigger is coming back to collect some dues . \" \\nbeyond the political aspects , \" sweet sweetback \" is an entertaining picture , which van peebles always intended it to be . \\nhe squeezed every drop out of his limited budget , and produced a film that , although dated now , was technically fantastic at the time . \\nhe shot in rough , documentary-like fashion , while also utilizing almost every visual and aural trick his technology would allow him . \\nhe makes good use of older techniques like split screens , freeze frames , reversed color schemes , and overlapping images . \\nthe only time the film ever looks bad is during the night sequences , because van peebles simply did not have the needed equipment . \\nwatching \" sweet sweetback \" more than twenty-five years after its initial release , one realizes that it still has bite . \\narguments can be made that race relations in the united states have made quantum leaps since the early seventies , but there are still problems that are reflected in this film . \\nbut there is more to the film than its racial aspect . \\nthe legacy of \" sweet sweetback\\'s baadasssss song \" is not only the plentiful amount of art and music told from the african-american perspective , but more importantly , the work of every artist who has fought to fund and produce that which is important to him . \\n',\n",

s by conveying the feel of authentic experience , the intensity of lived pain , and much of it seems trite and belaboured . \\nit unfolds , awkwardly , as a series of flashbacks , told during a luncheon in vienna , where jia-li meets her brother\\'s old flame ( teresa hu ) , now a concert pianist , whom she has not seen since college . \\nboth women seem rather sad , and resigned to their sadness . \\ntheir circumstances ( and those of jia-li\\'s brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man , chosen the wrong career path , etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate . \\nit is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didn\\'t . \\nthe problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry , she would still be just as unhappy . \\nfor a woman in modern taiwan , that day tells us , the cards are stacked , the dice are loaded : she can play the game , but the house always wins . \\nthe film\\'s sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan . \\nseen now , it does not seem provocative . \\nindeed , it\\'s hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious , it may be innovative , but it is also terribly , terribly dull . \\nand what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others , and his use of those methods is fumbling , uncertain , undisciplined . \\nnor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material . \\nthere are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couple\\'s first kiss , in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husband\\'s mistress--but they are brief . \\ntoo often , yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping , flower-arranging--in which nothing happens , little is said , no emotion imparted . \\nperhaps , if the film were content to focus on such reflective , inward moments , leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings , it might have been ambiguous , suggestive , insinuating . \\nbut jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems , at length , in detail , redundantly , and eliminate all subtleties . \\nat two hours and forty-five minutes , it all seems exorbitantly long , indulgently long-winded . \\nconsider the defining moment for jia-li , the titular day on the beach . \\nthe thrust of the whole film explains , easily enough , what we are to think of that moment , what it means when she walks away from a particular situation . \\neven so , the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally , in case we may have missed the point . \\nneedless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed , and that is the problem throughout . \\nthe look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative . \\nit was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least , it\\'s his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the world\\'s leading cinematographers . \\nin the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai , he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image . \\nyou would never know it from watching that day , which , due either to doyle\\'s inexperience or yang\\'s humdrum direction , is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible . \\nin scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage , that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience , but none of the damage , none of the heartbreak . \\n',\n",

marybeth tries to become buddies with stokely , since they both don\\'t have friends , etc . ) , when they all begin to suspect the teachers due to some grotesque and strange occurrences , the only people they can count on for help is each other , even though they aren\\'t really even sure if they can trust one another . \\n \" the faculty \" is another smart and pop-culturally hip film from williamson , although it does not equal up to his best film , the original \" scream , \" and rodriguez , whose \" from dusk till dawn \" is still one of the more original genre films of the 90\\'s . \\nwilliamson and rodriguez are so assured at their professions , respectively , that the idea of teaming up together is pretty much a no-brainer . \\nthe plotline of \" the faculty , \" involving aliens taking over other people\\'s bodies , has been done quite a lot before , from \" invasion of the body snatchers , \" to \" the puppet masters , \" to \" invaders from mars , \" so one of the obstacles that williamson and rodriguez had to overcome was to somehow make the idea seem fresh , and by setting the goings-on at a high school and having the protagonists be a group of teens , they were mostly successful . \\nsurely , the conventions of the story are still the same , and the climax was inevitable , but there were a few surprises along the way , including the question of who were the aliens , and who weren\\'t . \\nthe epilogue was also a refreshing change-of-pace as it did not set up a sequel but ended on a note that probably could not have been any better . \\nthe performances in \" the faculty \" were a treat throughout , since there were so many recognizable actors in roles that were the polar opposite of what they usually do . \\none exception were the teens , who , aside from elijah wood , are not very well-known , but they all aquit themselves nicely , particularly wood ( the seasoned pro ) , clea duvall , and jordanna brewster . \\nas members of the faculty , robert patrick ( \" t2 : judgement day \" ) was creepy as the gym coach ; piper laurie was amusing and threatening as the drama teacher ; bebe neuwirth actually was somehow able to look like an alien ; and salma hayek , as the school nurse with a bad case of the cold , was very funny in a small role . \\nthe standout , in my opinion , of the whole cast was famke janssen who turns in an oddly touching performance as the shy and meek english teacher who , after turning into an alien , becomes the sex bombshell . \\nif there was any problem i had with the faculty , it was that some of them were given no real payoff in the climactic sequence . \\nsince the teenagers realize that in order to save everyone they must kill the \" queen \" alien , many of the faculty members disappear . \\nit might have been more fun if they had to face every one of the teachers , although the finale is still pretty impressive , and includes some showstopping creature effects , especially for a relatively low 15-million-dollar budget . \\nalthough not one of the best horror or science-fiction films i have seen , \" the faculty \" is still an exciting and worthy film that dimension films was smart to release around the holiday season when this type of genre offering is usually not released . \\nwhile the story is as old as the hills , it is also , in a way , timeless , because everyone , i think , has suspected at one time or another that a certain person simply did not act right , as if they really weren\\'t human . \\nand by putting this idea in the setting of a small-town high school , it perfectly contrasts with the alienation that most teenagers usually go through when relating to adults and other peers . \\n+ note : the ad and poster campaign for this film is hugely misleading , as it features r & b artist usher raymond as one of the main characters . \\nin actuality , he only has a small role as one of stan\\'s buddies who becomes quarterback after stan resigns from the team . \\nif i were one of the heads from dimension , i would change this advertising at once , since it is unnecessary and rather deceiving . \\n',\n",
       " b'the promotion for fear and loathing in las vegas ? has made the film out to be a comedy , and for about the first hour or so it seems like it might be one . \\nit\\'s 1971 , and the hippie movement has left behind quite a few wash-outs , among them journalist raoul duke ( johnny depp ) and his \" attorney \" dr . gonzo ( benito del toro ) . \\nthese two spend most of the film in a drug-induced stupor , having strange hallucinations , trashing their hotel rooms , and either annoying or scaring almost everyone that crosses their path . \\nduke is first assigned to cover an outdoor desert motorcycle race in las vegas , but gets lost in a blur of drugs , beer , and flying dust , and ends up wandering around with no clue who won . \\nhe leaves vegas briefly before he is sent back , in what can only be described as a strangely appropriate twist of fate , to cover a drug enforcement conference . \\nfear and loathing has been misinterpreted by some as glorifying the use of drugs . \\nit doesn\\'t , even in the beginning--while the pair\\'s antics are sometimes amusing and relatively harmless at first , the humor here is still fairly dark . \\ndirector terry gilliam views them with a rather satirical eye , and even when we\\'re laughing , we\\'re laughing at them rather than with them . \\nthey spend most of their time paranoid , angry , or just plain befuddled , which is probably an understandable reaction to seeing the entire room suddenly fill up with giant reptiles . \\nthe black comedy may be entertaining to watch onscreen , but it\\'s probably not something most other audience members would want to experience first-hand . \\nall this aside , i was starting to grow a bit restless as the film drew near its one-hour mark , thinking to myself that i wanted something more out of this than just an off-kilter satire of drug culture . \\nthankfully , the script delivers it before too long , as duke , in a rare moment of lucidity , stops to recall how he was once an enthusiastic hippie , \" riding the wave \" of something that seemed special and important . \\nnow it\\'s six years later and the wave has finally broken , as he puts it . \\nmaterialistic culture is still alive and well and , for most of this film , right in his face in las vegas ; the \" american dream \" of which duke occasionally speaks is still just as shallow and phony as ever . \\nthe social protesters have lost , and the more questionable aspects of the movement have turned ugly and left casualties such as duke to drift in a sea of drugs and disillusionment . \\nin many ways , fear and loathing is gilliam\\'s most reality-based film ; all of his others , with the exception of the fisher king , have made use of some sort of fantasy or science-fiction plot elements . \\nyet it is his off-the-wall masterpiece brazil ? to which this film bears the most visual resemblance . \\nthe protagonist of brazil found himself alternately surrounded by a plastic , soulless society and the constant chaos of totalitarian police inspections and terrorist attacks , and similarly duke\\'s world is composed of the artificial , empty glam of las vegas and the bizarre anarchy of his drug hallucinations . \\nunlike the protagonist of brazil , however , duke is not a particularly admirable figure , and neither is gonzo . \\nduring the latter half of the film , their trips turn nastier and the consequences worse , eventually building up to an incident an a diner in which gonzo crudely frightens and humiliates a waitress , while duke , though he doesn\\'t seem to approve , doesn\\'t do anything to stop it either . \\nby the time this scene takes place , they don\\'t seem like hippies or peaceniks or protesters or anything of the sort any more ; they just seem like a couple of stoned jerks in a diner . \\nduke seems to realize at some level that he\\'s become something he doesn\\'t like , but he\\'s either too apathetic or too defeated to do anything to change . \\nthis film has taken a critical drubbing from many who view it as an essentially pointless film that simply throws one trip scene after another at the audience . \\nwhile gilliam may have overdone it in a few places , i think he and his co-writers deserve more credit than that . \\nthere\\'s plenty of substance here , particularly in the second half ; its observations about the broken and defeated rebels from the \\'60s and the objects of their rebellion just aren\\'t usually very pleasant . \\nunlike , say , brazil ? or the fisher king , both of which feature a character who dares to let himself dream in a repressive environment , fear and loathing in las vegas ? shows us someone who\\'s given up on his dreams and resorts to the quick fix of drugs . \\nin its own psychedelic , whacked-out way , it\\'s sad and regretful , but i think it\\'s also a bit of a kick in the pants , a challenge to find an alternative between chemically-induced withdrawal and the equally addictive drug of vegas-style materialism . \\nindeed , duke himself admits at one point that he\\'s never learned to accept that you can get higher without drugs than with them . \\ni\\'m not sure if he\\'s any closer to accepting it by the end or not , but i suspect the audience will get the idea . \\n',\n",

       " b'plot : during a 10-week span in london in the fall of 1888 , jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never uncovered , committed five ritualistic , grisly murders of prostitutes . \\nthis film is based on the graphic novel which assembled a theory behind the century-old mystery . \\ncritique : awesome ! \\ni love dark movies , i love stylish movies , i love good mysteries and i love johnny depp . . . so \\nyes , i really dug this movie ! \\nthe hughes brothers are back with a vengeance , out to show the world that they are directors to be taken seriously , and this movie , my friends . . . is \\nvery serious ! \\nin fact , it\\'s also very gruesome and bloody and morbid and creepy and black as hell . \\nit ain\\'t for the kids , i\\'ll tell you that much . \\nand if any of those recent hack directors of two-bit scream-esque slasher flicks want some advice on effective \" kill scenes \" , do not look any further , because each one committed to this film is a cinematic stunner , especially when compared to their generic slice-and-dice contrivances . \\nin fact , most of this film\\'s structure is very creative , the actors , all solid , the atmosphere and \" feel \" of the picture , remarkably real ( gotta love those \" unfortunates \" ) , and the descent into darkness , well honed by the filmmakers . \\nyou can almost taste the seediness off the screen and quickly come to appreciate the politics of the time . \\nbut it\\'s also an impressive mystery film , based on the true-life tale of jack the ripper , a man whose identity was never discovered . \\nthe theory in this film is based on the graphic novel \" from hell \" written by alan moore and presents a compelling story , which despite being a little oliver stone-ish , did manage to tie up all of its loose ends quite nicely , and present us with an entertaining bowl of mayhem , sexual depravity , drug usage , insanity , murders and love ? \\nyes , the brothers even managed to slip a little \" love \" story in here , and despite not truly being developed , i guess it could\\'ve been much worse and taken up more time than was provided already . \\nthat\\'s right , there\\'s no real need to put any \" romance \" in a film about a mass murderer ! \\nbut that aside , you gotta give up the props to actor extraordinaire johnny depp , who once again possesses the strength in character and flawless acting abilities , to center this movie all the way through . \\nsure , he\\'s just playing a less goofier version of his ichabod crane character from sleepy hollow , but he does it so well and even added a michael caine accent to his mixed bag of tricks in this one . \\ni was also surprised at how little heather graham annoyed me in this film ( i was sure that her presence would ruin this movie , but she was fine ) and how little the dreams/fantasies of depp\\'s character had to do with the film\\'s development ( from what i had seen in the trailer , i thought the filmmakers were going to make this the crux of the story , but thankfully , it wasn\\'t ) . \\non the downside , the film doesn\\'t really explain the whole freemasons cult organization real well and lacks character development . \\nbut then again , a story about the most mysterious serial killer of all-time is probably not the ideal spot for character refinement . \\ni mean , the less i knew about each person , the more suspicious i became of each one\\'s motives , reasons , etc . . . \\nin fact , i was actually quite surprised by who was presented as the killer in the end , and that was in part , due to the distance to which i\\'d been held from the film\\'s characters . . . or \\nam i giving the filmmakers too much credit for something that might not have been their intention ? \\nperhaps . \\noverall , this is an extremely creepy production , with glorious cinematography ( reminiscent of coppola\\'s dracula and burton\\'s sleepy hollow ) , a grim score and solid acting . \\nbut it\\'s not for everyone . \\nsome may be utterly repulsed by the gory particulars of these tragic events , and even though the murders aren\\'t shown as graphically as you might think , there\\'s enough here to send the squeamish right out the doors . \\nbut i for one love movies that blend their eclectic visual style with an interesting mystery and palpable , gothic atmosphere , and this flick is just that and plenty more ! \\nand god knows that i will certainly not be surrendering the burnt image of jack the ripper\\'s haunting cape silhouette and gleaming silver knife from my mind anytime soon . . . brrrrr ! \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nthe crow ( 9/10 ) - dark city ( 9/10 ) - dracula ( 7/10 ) - jfk ( 9/10 ) - the nightmare before christmas ( 10/10 ) - the ninth gate ( 8/10 ) - the others ( 9/10 ) - quills ( 8/10 ) - shadow of the vampire ( 6/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) \\n',\n",
       " b'after 1993\\'s \" falling down , \" i hoped that joel schumacher would mature into a great director . \\nsince then he has offered us two so-so adaptations of john grisham novels ( \" the client \" and \" a time to kill \" ) and two batman movies that lowered the standards of that franchise . \\nalthough these disappointments dampened my enthusiasm for schumacher\\'s potential , the publicity for his latest release , \" 8mm , \" raised new hope . \\nit promised to be something unusual . \\nit wasn\\'t . \\nthe plot goes like this : tom welles ( nicolas cage ) is a private eye who is hired by a wealthy woman , allegorically named mrs . christian ( myra carter ) , to investigate an 8mm movie found among her late husband\\'s belongings . \\nthe movie appears to be a snuff film in which a teenage girl is raped and murdered by a man in a leather mask ( who reminds me of bane in schumacher\\'s \" batman & robin \" ) . \\nbecause murders can be realistically simulated in movies , mrs . christian wants tom to discover if the girl is alive or dead . \\nby combing through missing persons reports , tom finds the girl\\'s name and tracks her to los angeles . \\nwith the aid of max california ( joaquin phoenix ) , a video store clerk ( and another symbolic name ) , tom wanders through the underworld of pornography in search of snuff . \\nthe plot bears an obvious resemblance to paul schrader\\'s \" hardcore , \" in which a father goes deeper and deeper into the industries of porn and sex to find his missing daughter . \\nboth films are modeled on dante\\'s \" the inferno , \" of course ; \" 8mm \" makes that connection overly obvious by casting max as virgil and having him constantly tell tom that they were heading toward a meeting with the devil . \\n \" hardcore \" is a much more subtle and meaningful film . \\n \" 8mm \" had a lot of promise . \\nin its better moments it\\'s an examination of violence as entertainment and of the beast within even a nice guy like tom . \\none moment of the first sort : when we first meet max he\\'s reading truman capote\\'s \" in cold blood \" underneath the cover of a porn novel . \\n \" in cold blood \" was the father of the true-crime genre , which is the literary equivalent of snuff films . \\nmax promises that we will see examples of the second theme when he tells tom , \" dance with the devil and the devil don\\'t change ; the devil changes you . \" \\ntom does change-i\\'ll let you discover the specifics for yourself-but not permanently . \\nschumacher and screenwriter andrew kevin walker didn\\'t have the guts to take tom so far down the dark tunnel that he couldn\\'t come back . \\n ( walker\\'s \" seven \" did a much better job on that theme by refusing to compromise ) . \\ncage tries hard to pull it off , but the script doesn\\'t give him enough to work with . \\nphoenix walks away with the movie-he\\'s smart , charming , and funny . \\nother cast members include \" fargo \" \\'s peter stormare camping it up as porn auteur dino velvet and \" the sopranos \" \\'s james gandolfini as a soulless porn merchant who pushes tom too far . \\nin the last analysis , since \" 8mm \" falls short of its pretensions and its promise , its just another private eye story in the raymond chandler/ross macdonald tradition of having the detective uncover the depravity behind the glossy facade of wealth and privilege . \\nhowever , unlike other predictable fare in the genre-last year\\'s \" twilight , \" for example- \" 8mm \" is especially disappointing because it could have been much more than it is . \\n',\n",

       " b'the ultimate match up between good and evil , \" the untouchables \" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry . \\nbased on the 1959 television show of the same title , \" the untouchables \" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script . \\nthe film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public . \\nelliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order . \\nhowever , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws . \\nthe fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes . \\nthe film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws . \\nthe film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone\\'s men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl . \\nfrom this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard . \\nright from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs . \\nthis developed hatred is before the film\\'s hero , ness , is even introduced . \\ni found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone . \\nthe film only gets better from this point . \\nwith the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats . \\nthey walk in unison and they only look forward . \\nas they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens . \\nholding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films . \\none that comes to mind is \" the matrix \" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world . \\nwearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930\\'s style , the similarities between these two are countless . \\n \" the untouchables \" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film . \\nthe four members were the only ones willing to go against capone\\'s army . \\neach member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others . \\nelliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film . \\nhe begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be . \\nhowever , as the film develops so does ness . \\nhis beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side . \\nhe also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends . \\nhis anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in . \\nsean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables . \\nmalone acts as a mentor to ness . \\nhe teaches him \" the chicago way \" to do things ;

       " b'in roger michell\\'s romantic comedy notting hill , william thacker ( hugh grant ) leads a rather dreary life maintaining his flagging travel bookshop in the quaint section of london which lends it\\'s name to the film\\'s title . \\none day , american movie superstar anna scott ( julia roberts ) walks in to purchase a book on turkey . \\nquickly enamored of each other , the two embark upon an on-again , off-again love affair replete with romance , humor , and the occasional lump in the throat . \\nthe film opens with a non-verbal cue to anna\\'s stardom as the title credits appear over a montage of slow motion sequences featuring the actress\\'s appearances in films and at premieres - coming out of limousines , walking the red carpets and such . \\nwithout words , this sequence gives us a background to her character . \\nfollowing , however , is a set-up narration by william indicating what he does and where he lives . \\ni don\\'t know why the filmmakers chose to go with a narration which tells us nothing we couldn\\'t have figured out by watching the first ten minutes of film , and which never resurfaces after the movie\\'s beginning , but there it is . \\nif there were ever a clear case for \" less is more , \" this would be it . \\nthe film is told nearly first person from william\\'s point of view , as he is in every scene . \\nby nature of this arrangement , we get a very definite sense of what he is all about , and his nice guy personality wins us over easily . \\nin fact , much of notting hill\\'s strength lies in the great dialog written for this character by richard curtis . \\na scene where william is still in shock over the fact that he\\'s even talking to a silver screen goddess is made golden by the way bumbles through his attempt to offer her some honey-soaked apricots from his refrigerator . \\nor take an instance where anna kisses william and asks him never to tell anyone for fear of the incident hurting her image . \\nwilliam assures her he wouldn\\'t say a word , then adds , \" well , i\\'ll probably tell myself now and then , but i\\'d never believe it . \" \\ngreat stuff . \\nthe downside to spending so much time with william is that we don\\'t get to see enough of anna to make their relationship whole and plausible . \\nwe\\'re constantly exposed to william\\'s thoughts , feelings , actions and desires , but don\\'t actually get the sense of how much anna really feels for him . \\nthere are a couple of instances where she declares her obvious interest , but they nearly come out of nowhere due to the fact that we\\'re not sure what she\\'s been thinking all the times in between . \\nthis , combined with the sheer iniquity of screen time between the two , makes this hugh grant\\'s film hands down . \\nhe gets the great scenes ( look for one in which he has to portray an interviewer from horse and hound magazine in order to speak with anna ) , the great lines , and gives an overall wonderful performance . \\njulia roberts fans will probably be disappointed by the actress\\'s top billing and subsequent lack of involvement in the film ( ala sandra bullock in a time to kill ) along with her detached performance which is only worsened by her character\\'s unpredictable behavior . \\nanna doesn\\'t get a lot of our compassion . \\nthis romantic comedy leans a little more toward the comedy than the romance , much of it supplied by grant himself , but with considerable help from the supporting cast . \\nmost notable is rhys ifans as spike , william\\'s eccentric roommate , who is in the film for no other purpose than to make us laugh . \\nhugh bonneville , emma chambers , james dreyfus , and gina mckee bring up the guard as william\\'s friends and family , particularly shining in a scene where william brings anna to his sister\\'s birthday dinner , and we get to see how these common folks react to the presence of a movie star in their midst . \\nit\\'s a scene most of us will probably think would play out in our own living rooms were we faced with a similar situation . \\nroger michell\\'s use of visuals doesn\\'t sweep us off our feet , but does give us more than your typical movie of this type . \\nfor example , there are a couple of instances in this film where large amounts of time pass . \\nwhereas some films are content to simply put in a caption saying \" eight months later , \" michell presents us with more interesting cues , such as william\\'s walk though his neighborhood while the seasons change around him . \\nanother memorable shot occurs in a park where the camera is lifted from ground level to a couple of hundred feet in the air . \\nwe\\'re generally used to scenes where our point of view is lifted from the earth to treetop level or so , but in this case , the camera just keeps going up and up until we have a bird\\'s eye view of the ground below . \\nmusic is used rather glaringly as an enhancement to many of the film\\'s scenes , and some of this might have been better toned down , but in other areas it works to full effect . \\nit\\'s kind of a mixed bag , but still fares better than many of today\\'s lighthearted movies which are so influenced by the mtv fare that the film becomes one long music video . \\nat least this film has some pretty good music that for the most part remains relevant and appropriate . \\nnotting hill\\'s grant and roberts will not go down in history as one of the all-time greatest film pairings , but the chemistry is decent and the comedic aspects of the movie more than make up for it . \\nfor a couple of hours , you should expect to laugh more than cry , and that\\'s not so bad , now is it ? \\n',\n",

\\ngo clubbing ! \\nsure , that makes sense . \\narquette , byrne , and pryce give it the old college try , but their characters are so one-dimensional that they just appear to be sleepwalking . \\nscenes between arquette and byrne that were probably supposed to be sexually charged fall almost embarrassingly flat , because the setup of the romantic subplot is so clumsily handled that it almost reaches the point of becoming laughable . \\neven though frankie page\\'s life is falling apart before her very eyes , she still finds the time to hit on a priest who wanders in to her hair salon . \\neven more curiously , he seems to be interested in her advances . \\nfather andrew\\'s religious doubt pops up so suddenly that it seems more silly than dramatic . \\nas for pryce , he may as well wear a curled mustache and cackle , \" i\\'ll get you , my pretty , \" for all the depth his cardinal houseman is afforded . \\ntrust me , i\\'m not revealing anything by telling you pryce turns out to be a villain . \\nwhat\\'s worse , after being faced with dull characters and the prospect of having annoying camera tricks and loud music jammed down our throats , we now have to contend with a story that starts off in one direction , veers off in another , then another , and ends up being totally incomprehensible . \\nfirst of all , the film doesn\\'t even bother to explain what should be very simple plot details . how does frankie get the stigmata merely by touching a rosary ? \\nhow come an atheist like her was chosen , since father andrew mentions that only very devout believers have ever received stigmata ? \\nactually , i\\'m not sure what frankie was posessed by . \\nsupposedly , stigmata occurs when one is posessed by the holy spirit , but the film later has her being posessed by the dead priest , and later by some evil spirit ( i think ) . \\nwhich one is it ? \\nthe answer to this question , of course , is very simple : the possessing entity in each scene is determined by whichever effects and flashy camera work mr . wainwright wants to use this time . \\nfurthermore , the ending is a ridiculously neat little wrap-up , and the filmmakers compound this problem by ultimately turning the film into a diatribe against the catholic church . \\nif you do any research at all about the gospel of st . thomas , you\\'ll find that it is not being suppressed by the church ( as the film seems to claim ) , but that it is readily available at your local library . \\nthere\\'s nothing the catholics need to worry about , though . \\n \" stigmata\\'s \" religion is so off-base that it can\\'t be confused for anything remotely resembling the real catholic church . \\nif they wanted to portray catholic priests as mobsters , they should have gone all-out and equipped them with sharkskin suits and tommy guns , which would have been far more interesting . \\ni\\'m not catholic ; in fact , i don \\'t care much for the catholic church , but its cartoonish misrepresentation in this film should not be considered realistic by any means . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film that fails on as many levels as \" stigmata \" does . \\nit\\' s not thought-provoking , though it would like to be , and it is definitely not scary , though it pretends to be . \\ni\\'m not sure why they tried to pass this off as a horror film , because there is absolutely nothing scary about the story . \\nmaybe it\\'s an attempt to cover up the fact that none of the scenes have any dramatic weight whatsoever . \\nthe initial shock of seeing arquette covered with blood is dulled by the fact that it happens over , and over , and over . \\nlike so many films of the mtv generation , this one suffers from overkill . \\nso much is overdone in \" stigmata , \" that it eventually has no effect on the audience , leaving us to pick out the film\\'s ( many ) flaws . \\ni\\'m also still trying to figure out why the quotation they take from the gospel of st . thomas is so earth-shattering . \\nwhen we finally hear it , the saying sounds like something every five-year-old learns on their first day of sunday school , which means that for all its flash , the whole film is really much ado about nothing . \\nthe dog days of summer usually produce one monstrous dog , and \" stigmata \" is it . \\n',\n",

s : the \" he would have wanted you to have this \" moment , where one character gives another a trinket that yet another character is established as constantly having ( and is usually made fun of by the character who ends up getting all sappy over it later on ) . \\nscenes like these always bother me when they come out of nowhere in regular films , but in a film as clich ? ridden as this , it is particularly irritating . \\nennio morricone\\'s music is usually considered to be some of the best stuff in the projects he works on , but here it is dreadfully overbearing . \\nhis music sounds like it came straight out of a vincent price movie in certain scenes . \\nat other times his music is unbearably over-dramatic . \\none sequence involving a daring spacewalk rescue is given a particularly cheesy sting when it is discovered that the grappling hook device used for the rescue won\\'t reach its intended target . \\nmission to mars is push button filmmaking to the greatest extreme . \\nevents are set into motion that are obvious to anyone who has ever seen a movie and seem like they are just there to evoke an emotional response in the audience . \\nwe are apparently supposed to be upset that tim robbins character removes his helmet in deep space and kills himself to save his wife , but i felt extreme boredom coupled with a twinge of disinterest . \\nwhat makes it all worse is that fact that there is no real reason that robbins\\' character needs to turn himself into a popsicle , except to invoke an emotional response ( i could think of at least one way to save him , and the nasa clowns in this film are supposed to be \" smarter \" than i am ) . \\nduring the finale , when we are finally introduced to the translucent , conehead , kitty-faced aliens that we ostensibly sprung from , we are presented with some of the most ridiculously cartoonish cgi ever put to film ( just slightly worse than the plane crash at the end of air force one or the hell scenes in spawn ) . \\na brief history lesson about \" where we came from \" is proffered , then sinise is whisked away to be with \" the rest of our people \" ( he does this because his late wife proclaims in a video he watches early on that \" this is a chance to step foot where no one else has \" ) . \\n>from the press i\\'ve been seeing this film receive , it is apparent that mission to mars will be dying a quick death at the theater . \\ni\\'m sure the first weekend or two will be huge , but once word gets out people will stop going . \\nlet\\'s just hope the upcoming red planet is better than this and isn\\'t hurt by the negativity this film is generating . \\ni\\'d venture to say it won\\'t be worse than this waste of time . \\n[pg] \\n',\n",
       " b'in this year\\'s summer movie preview issue of _entertainment_weekly_ , theresa connelly described her writing-directing debut , _polish_wedding_ , as \" a child that did not quite become the child i thought it would . \" \\none wonders what exactly she originally had in mind for this jumbled film , a comedy-drama that appears doomed at its most basic elements . \\nthe family at the center of _polish_wedding_ is the pzoniaks , which consists of mother jadzia ( lena olin ) , father bolek ( gabriel byrne ) , sole daughter hala ( claire danes ) and four sons of varying degrees of facelessness . \\nit\\'s a large family , but there\\'s not a sympathetic one in the whole bunch , certainly not in the primary trio . \\njadzia takes pride in building and maintaining a home and family , but she\\'s kind of a hypocrite since she\\'s carrying on an affair with a businessman rade serbedzija ) . \\nher excuse for her affair is neglect from bolek , who is such a passive wimp that one cannot connect with his sadness and frustration . \\nalso , how could he possibly pay so little attention to the saucy , sexy jadzia ? \\nhala is a spoiled , self-centered high school dropout whose reckless sexual experimentation predictably leads to pregnancy . \\nwith such an unappealing set of characters , it\\'s no surprise that _polish_wedding_\\'s plot complications are far from involving . \\nnaturally , jadzia and bolek would like hala to marry the young cop , russell schuster ( adam trese ) , who fathered the child , but he refuses to make such a commitment . \\nho-hum . \\nanother complication , involving the decidedly un-virginal hala being selected to crown a statue of the virgin mary , is first played for laughs and then , inexplicably , as a profound statement in the film\\'s climax--which , ironically , is funnier than any of the film\\'s lame attempts at humor , such as a painfully labored slapstick attempt where jadzia leads her sons in a charge to beat up russell . \\nthat scene is but one in a number of writing miscues by connelly . \\nthe jadzia-bolek conflict is resolved in an overly pat way not unfamiliar to sitcom viewers . \\nthe hala-russell conflict isn\\'t resolved in as contrived a manner , but their ultimate resolution will leave viewers wondering if they had missed something . \\nand then there\\'s some atrocious dialogue , which i am sure was not supposed to be as ridiculous as they sound : \" look at all these pickles . \\njust looking at them gives me such great sadness . \" \\nas misguided as _polish_wedding_ is , the affair is something of a letdown , considering the strong performances by byrne , danes , and especially the fiery olin . \\nthey obviously believed in connelly and her material--a faith that audiences will be hard-pressed to share . \\n',\n",
       " b'in december of 1996 , a little movie called \" scream , \" was released , became a box-office smash , and resurrected films targeted at teens . \\nfirst , it was teen slasher movies that were the big fad ( both \" scream \" movies , \" i know what you did last summer , \" \" urban legend , \" etc . ) , but just recently , the popularity has switched over to the teen comedy genre ( a \\'la \\'80s john hughes ) , starting with last june\\'s \" can\\'t hardly wait . \" \\nit may be the first week of april in 1999 , but so far this year we have been given a movie aimed at the 25-and-under market almost every single week : \" varsity blues , \" \" jawbreaker , \" \" cruel intentions , \" \" simply irresistible , \" \" the rage : carrie 2 , \" and \" the mod squad . \" \\ncoming april 9 are two more of this type : \" never been kissed \" and \" go , \" and on april 23 , we\\'ve got the teen satire \" election \" and the teen horror-comedy \" idle hands . \" \\njeesh ! \\nout of all of these moves , however , the one that is most similar to the latest incarnation , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" is this past january\\'s mediocre , ho-hum \" she\\'s all that . \" \\nalthough similar in plotting ( ok , darn near identical ) , \" 10 things i hate about you , \" a modern-day version of shakespeare\\'s \" the taming of the shrew \" ( \" she\\'s all that \" got its inspiration from \" pygmalion \" ) , is an infinitely superior film in every department , from the smart direction by first-time feature director gil junger to the charming and well-written screenplay by karen mccullah lutz and kirsten smith to the striking ensemble cast , who give the best group of performances in a teen comedy since 1985\\'s \" the breakfast club . \" \\nand to top it all off , in the inevitable climax set at the prom , at least we didn\\'t have to once again suffer through a goofy , inappropriate dance sequence ( who could forget , or want to remember , for that matter , this ludicrous development in \" she\\'s all that ? \" ) . \\nthe day wide-eyed , shy new student cameron james ( joseph gordon-levitt ) starts school at seattle-based padua high , he is swept away at the sight of the beautiful and popular sophomore , bianca stratford ( larisa oleynik ) . \\nalthough he doesn\\'t know french , he purposefully learns some of it just so he can tutor her , but finds that her paranoid gynecologist father ( larry miller ) won\\'t allow her to date until her bitter , unconventional older sister , kat ( julia stiles ) , a senior , decides to . \\nkat , of course , has sworn off the likes of boys , but cameron sets out to find someone that will be the perfect match for her , which is exactly what he finds in the form of the rebellious patrick verona ( heath ledger ) . \\ncomplicating matters , cameron\\'s dorky friend , michael ( david krumholtz ) , decides to use a wealthy jock , joey ( andrew keegan ) , who also has his sights set on bianca , as a pawn so that he will pay patrick to get kat to go out with him , and then cameron hopes to steal bianca away from joey . \\nas you can see , \" 10 things i hate about you \" includes a huge number of characters , some of which i haven\\'t even mentioned , such as kat\\'s shakespeare-obsessed friend , mandella ( susan may pratt ) and bianca\\'s materialistic comrade , chastity ( gabrielle union ) . \\nat a short , but well-used running time of 98 minutes , all of the characters are perfectly handled , satisfyingly developed , and , for the most part , are not treated as caricatures ( another flaw of \" she\\'s all that , \" where the bad guys ( and gals ) ran around constantly saying , \" you\\'re vapor \" ) . \\nsince i could sympathize with the realistic depictions of the central characters , and since many of the comedic and dramatic scenes were surprisingly effective , i got completely caught up in all of the relationships and was thoroughly entertained . \\naside from a good screenplay , it\\'s the performances that can make or break a movie , and director junger has really hit the jackpot . \\naside from joseph gordon-levitt ( \" 3rd rock from the sun \" ) , who gives his strongest performance to date here , none of the actors are that well-known , but it is this aspect that brings a particular freshness to the proceedings . \\nas the main character of kat , julia stiles ( last seen in the miniseries \" the \\'60s \" ) is marvelous and always believable , and certainly has a bright future ahead of her . \\neven though it is her role that is initially the most difficult and hard-edged , it was easy to identify with kat\\'s way of thinking ( she is against the silly tradition of the prom and loves reading sylvia plath ) , and i completely admired her individuality . \\nno one , i think , could have portrayed her as perfectly as stiles does . \\nheath ledger , as the infamous bad-boy of the town , injects much life into patrick , and has a lot of chemistry with stiles . \\none other actor of note is larisa oleynik who , with the help of screenwriters lutz and smith , is able to turn bianca into a person with multi-dimensions , even though she is accurately self-centered at the on-set . \\nin one truthful scene , cameron angrily asks her if she has always been so selfish , and bianca grudgingly realizes that yes , she has . \\none off-beat element of the film , and a source of some hearty laughs , is the way that the school\\'s staff act , which is strikingly unformal . \\nallison janney , as the guidance counselor ms . perky , who is writing a trashy harlequin romance novel , is comic dynamite , as is daryl \" chill \" mitchell as the english teacher , who reads shakespeare to the class in rap and , at one point , sends kat to the office because , for once , she actually thinks one of his assignments is really good . \\nalthough there are a few cheap laughs that are thrown into the film near the beginning , most of it actually works , especially in the humorous and witty dialogue exchanges and quirks between the characters . \\nin one very funny scene , chastity asks , \" i know people can be overwhelmed , and they can be underwhelmed , but can people just be . . . whelmed ? \" \\nat another point , bianca and kat\\'s father ( a stand-out larry miller ) , who is constantly terrified that his daughters are going to get pregnant , only allows bianca to go to the prom on one occasion : before she leaves , she has to put on the heavy fat suit he has so she will get an idea of what it\\'s like to be pregnant . \\n \" 10 things i hate about you \" once and for all proves that there is still life in the teen comedy genre , and this movie is probably more reminiscent of the great john hughes than any other film of the \\'90s . \\nit also helps that the movie has a perfectly-assembled soundtrack , mixing indie-rock with new wave \\'80s songs ( and with , thank goodness , no rap ) . \\nby the film\\'s end , it actually had me rooting for certain characters to get together , and i was also quite pleased with how everything was wrapped up , especially in the final scenes involving kat and bianca , kat and her father , and a flawlessly-acted and moving sequence in which kat gets up to read the poem she has written for her english class ( this is where the title comes from ) . \\nluckily , i doubt i would be able to find ten things i hate about \" 10 things i hate about you , \" but the positive aspects of the film far out-number ten . \\n',\n",
       " b'the ads for \" batman and robin \" scream \" the event of the summer is here \" and that\\'s the problem . \\nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \\n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \\nit\\'s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \\nit wasn\\'t always this way . \\ntim burton\\'s \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \\nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \\nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \\nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \\nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city\\'s breathtaking gothic skyline . \\nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \\n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60\\'s batman tv show than with tim burton\\'s tale of darkness . \\nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \\na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \\nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn\\'t the faintest notion of what to do . \\n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it\\'s often difficult to tell who\\'s whacking who . \\nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \\na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \\n \" batman and robin \" doesn\\'t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \\nit\\'s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \\nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \\neasily the best batman yet , clooney\\'s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn\\'t even hint at . \\nthe film\\'s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne\\'s butler and surrogate father . \\nas for the other heroes , chris o\\'donnell\\'s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \\nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne\\'s girlfriend is puzzling . \\ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \\nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that\\'s where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \\nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \\nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he\\'s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \\numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \\nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it\\'s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \\nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \\nthurman fails to maintain the character\\'s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \\nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \\njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \\nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \\ni don\\'t think so . \\nmy prescription ? \\nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist\\'s convention so he\\'ll understand that there\\'s no hard feelings ) . \\ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o\\'donnell and michael gough . \\ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . \\nthen , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \\n',\n",

       " b\"this movie about two dysfunctional families never really gets off the ground , despite some good performances from a basically competent cast . \\neddie ( sean penn ) and maureen ( robin wright penn ) are a not-so-happily married couple down on their luck . \\nliving in rented rooms in the seedier part of an unnamed city , they spend what little income they have at the local bar , owned by shorty ( stanton ) , eddie's best friend , and his wife georgie ( mazar ) . \\nmaureen and eddie share an odd relationship marked by eddie's frequent disappearances . \\non his return , he promises her the world and professes his undying love . \\ntheir manic reunions all too soon lead to new lows , as eddie disappears again . \\nlike a junky craving the next high , maureen suffers through the lows to reach the next high . \\ntheir relationship is further complicated by maureen's pregnancy . \\nshe wants the baby and the father , but deep down seems to sense the inevitability of losing the latter . \\nduring one of eddie's absences , maureen is attacked by kiefer , her neighbor , who gets her drunk ( with her cooperation ) and then insists on intimacy . \\nshe leaves badly bruised and in fear of what eddie might do -- not to her , but to kiefer . \\nshe lies about what happens to ensure that no harm will come to eddie as the result of his inevitable rage . \\nhe lashes out as she expects , and ends up in an institution for what he believes to be 3 months -- but in reality is 10 years . \\nduring this decade , maureen divorces eddie and remarries a more solid and reliable individual , joey ( travolta , in a small role ) . \\nher life falls apart again when eddie is released from the institution and comes to find her . \\njoey insists on bringing eddie into his home and making his wife choose between her husband ( and father of two children ) and stability ( joey makes a good living , drives a cadillac , and they live in a large house in the suburbs ) and the love of her previous life . \\nshe chooses her past , and sacrifices not only her new life but her old ( by giving up her and eddie's daughter to joey ) . \\nbut the eddie that she knew is gone , replaced by a mere shell of the man he was . \\nmaureen is herself a mere shell , more an automaton than a woman -- as if she had gone through whatever therapy and treatment eddie was given along with him . \\nperhaps these two really do need each other and can find happiness ( or maybe the lack of sadness ) together , but the movie's denouement was not convincing . \\n\",\n",
       " b'the lives of older people in the twilight of their years attempting to come to grips with their shared histories and possible futures is a fascinating topic . \\nfinding an all-star cast for such a film is a stroke of genius . \\ncombining all that with a three-time oscar-winning director ( robert benton of \" kramer vs . \\nkramer \" ) and creating a decidedly mediocre movie is the stuff of disappointment . \\nin yet another noir mystery set in hollywood -- how many of these have we seen during the past few years ? \\n-- the atmosphere is moody , the actors enjoyable to watch and the story goes nowhere . \\nover-70 harry ross ( paul newman ) is a washed up cop-turned-private eye-turned man friday trying to figure out how to live what remains of his life . \\nhe\\'s screwed up things pretty well ( \" i had a wife and daughter . \\nnow , i\\'m a drunk ) and is at a crossroads . \\na couple of years ago , he traveled to mexico to bring back mel ( reese witherspoon ) , the under-age daughter of jack ( gene hackman ) and catherine ( susan sarandon ) ames and now lives with them . \\nthe ames are former movie stars , past their prime and the three have become fast friends . \\none gets the impression that ross is just hanging out waiting for something to wake him up . \\nto fill his time , he does odd jobs for jack and falls in love with catherine . \\njack is in even worse shape than harry . \\nhe\\'s dying of cancer with only a year to live . \\nthings do turn more exciting when jack asks harry to drop off a sealed manila envelope for him . \\ninstead of the routine errand that ross expects , he walks into a barrage of bullets from the gun of another ex-cop who is , himself , full of bloody holes . \\nthis unsettling event gives the former detective a project to throw himself into and launches an investigation that revolves around the mysterious disappearance of catherine\\'s first husband 20 years before . \\nthrough a series of very complex and convoluted plot devices that involve murder ; blackmail ; guns ; mel\\'s mexico traveling partner and his parole officer ; ross\\'s former cop buddies , ex-lover and would-be sidekick , the tale finally ends up exactly where everyone expects it to . \\nit\\'s a film noir tradition that the story twists and turns down side roads for an unexpected finale , but here the journey meanders towards an ending that no one cares about . \\nthe only surprises are exactly whose face fits which role in the scenario . \\nby the time they show you , it doesn\\'t matter . \\nthe storyline gets goofier and goofier exemplified in ross\\'s relationship with rubin ( giancarlo esposito ) , a partner wannabe . \\nthese scenes are obviously designed to be comic relief , however they are neither . \\nrubin and ross have some past relationship but either it\\'s not explained or i didn\\'t care enough at that point to remember . \\na running joke about where harry was supposedly shot while in mexico is probably meant to mirror his questions about whether he is still able to perform . \\nit\\'s also not funny , doesn\\'t connect and keeps on showing up long after it has run its course . \\non the positive side , it\\'s often enjoyable to watch the seasoned actors on the screen . \\nthe three leads all have well-deserved academy awards and turn in accomplished , if not extraordinary jobs . \\nnewman is a grand actor , but doesn\\'t seem quite suited to the dark film style . \\nhe is a bit too clean and understated to come across as desperate and down and out . \\nhackman , also low-key , is believable but lacks sparkle . \\nsarandon comes across well as an sultry older babe although she is one-dimensional . \\nthe actors do what they can with lame dialog , but they can\\'t pull the film out of the hole it\\'s dug for itself . \\njames garner who plays ross\\'s old buddy ex-cop raymond hope is always a treat , but even he half-heartedly struggles through lines like \" i\\'m glad they didn\\'t shoot your pecker off . \" \\nthe best part of the film is the look at old friends , how their relationships change over the years and the difficult choices they must make . \\nthe genuinely easy and casual interactions among the actors hint that being on the set was much more interesting than what ended up on the screen \\nthe film doesn\\'t run very long before the audience realizes that it\\'s hopeless . \\nthe only reason for watching is the actors . \\nit reminds me of disaster movies such as \" towering inferno \" where the star power is supposed to make everyone ignore the film\\'s problems . \\nin a better world , there would have been second-rate actors in this second-rate movie and the ones here would have been saved for something better . \\nof course , we don\\'t live in that better world , but you could make yours a little nicer by choosing a different movie . \\n',\n",

       " b'synopsis : captain picard and the crew of the starship enterprise disobey federation orders and defend a peaceful community of 600 , the ba\\'ku , from the evil admiral dougherty and ru\\'afro . \\nthe enterprise crew , in the meantime , experience the rejuvenating qualities of the ba\\'ku homeworld : lt . worf grows a pimple , data sings opera pieces , picard scores with a ba\\'ku chick , riker shaves while sharing a bubblebath with troi , and the enterprise women note their firmer breasts . \\ncomments : \" star trek : the next generation \" was a hugely successful sequel tv series to \" star trek , \" a science fiction series which developed a devoted fan following in the 1970s . \\neven though it still enjoyed high ratings , \" star trek : the next generation \" ended production after seven years so that the cast could replace the original \" star trek \" \\'s cast in paramount\\'s film franchise centering on the voyages of the starship enterprise . \\nstar trek : insurrection is the ninth \" star trek \" movie and the third to focus on the \" star trek : the next generation \" crew . \\nstar trek : insurrection qualifies as one of those movies star trek fans , such as myself , would rate somewhere between \" okay \" and \" good . \" \\nafter star trek v : the final frontier , a nearly awful movie almost as bad as the repugnant \" star trek : voyager \" tv series , \" star trek \" fans could probably swallow anything paramount throws out in the trek film franchise . \\ni don\\'t wish to spend this review comparing insurrection to the eight other trek movies . \\nmost people reading this probably haven\\'t followed \" star trek \" anyway , so a comparison would seem tedious at best . \\nlet me , thus , make my comparisons briefly so that it\\'s out of my system : star trek : insurrection is not as good as the previous installment , star trek : first contact ; star trek : insurrection\\'s comic tone may be best compared to star trek iv : the voyage home ; star trek ii : the wrath of khan is still the best trek movie . \\nokay . let\\'s move to the movie itself . \\nstar trek : insurrection infuses a basic science fiction premise , humanity\\'s exploration and colonization of space , with a lot of lowbrow humor and witty oneliners . \\nthis combination works well more often than it fails , but when it does fail , the humor really seems cheesy . \\nmuch of this film appeals to trek fans\\' nostalgic fondness for the starship enterprise\\'s crew . \\naudiences unfamiliar with trek lore may miss the significance of some plot points and may even become confused at times . \\nstar trek : insurrection begins with scenes of the tranquil life on the ba\\'ku homeworld . \\nforget the actors and special effects , the beautiful setting of this movie , with its snowy mountaintops and verdant valleys , steals the show . \\nthis tranquility , however , is broken by data , an android , who reveals to the ba\\'ku that they are being secretly monitored by the federation and their alien allies , the son\\'a . \\nit seems that this world is a veritable fountain of youth , sustaining its inhabitants indefinantly in a young , healthy state . \\nthe enterprise crew , led by captain picard , investigates data\\'s actions and uncovers a conspiracy between the son\\'a and an enterprise admiral to relocate the ba\\'ku and plunder the planet\\'s youth-restoring properties . \\nsound pretty heavy ? \\nit is , though this plot , anything but unique and groundbreaking , is undermined by the film\\'s constant barrage of humor . \\nwhen going after data , for instance , picard sings an opera piece with him ( this is supposed to be cute and humorous ) . \\nin a much more funny sequence , work grows a large pimple on the side of his nose as a result of his exposure to the ba\\'ku homeworld , a pimple which his crewmates , try as they might , cannot avoid looking at . \\nthe acting in star trek : insurrection is , for the most part , pretty good . \\nsince they\\'ve been playing these characters for years , those portraying the enterprise crew reassume their roles effortlessly enough . \\nthe terrific actor patrick stewart plays captain jean-luc picard and delivers a moral speech , picard\\'s trademark , with his usual aplomb . \\nbrent spiner , another fine actor , plays the android data well enough again and provides the best moments of comic relief in the film ( though the old android-wishing-to-be-human motif will tire some trek fans familiar with the routine from the tv series ) . \\nthe supporting cast who appear in this movie alone are also pretty good . \\ndespite many other critics\\' negative opinions , f . murray abraham ( the winner of an academy award for his performance in amadeus ) plays the major villain ru\\'afro well enough . \\nru\\'afro reminds me , somewhat , of the baron harkonnen in the 1984 film version of dune . \\nlike the baron , ru\\'afro continuously has his skin looked after : it is stretched and stapled by servants . \\nin one particularly memorable scene , ru\\'afro becomes very agitated , and his facial skin splits open and bleeds . \\nru\\'afro is no khan from star trek ii--the best trek villain ever--but he is much better than the forgettable dr . soran from star trek : generations . \\n ( okay , i promise , no more comparisons . ) \\ndonna murphy must also be noted as a ba\\'ku woman , anij , who picard falls in love with . \\nmurphy is not a young woman with a supermodel body ; she is a mature woman with an attractive countenance . \\nthis is the type of woman whom picard , for those who know the character well , would be enchanted with . \\nin fact , the chemistry between murphy and stewart works very well here . \\na particular plot point involving anij\\'s ability to slow time down , an ability which she shares with picard , becomes one of the most intriguing parts of the movie . \\nfor as good as the actors and setting were , star trek : insurrection\\'s special effects were surprisingly disappointing . \\nthey proved adequate , sometimes barely , for a 1990s mainstream science fiction film , but they fell way short of the standard trek movie and paled in comparison to those seen in the trailer for star wars : the phantom menace ( a trailer which reportedly preceded many showings of insurrection ) . \\nthe space battles involving the enterprise and sona ships , in particular , seemed trite and unsuspenseful , and the final confrontation between picard and ru\\'afro took place on a completely unconvincing interior of a satellite . \\nthe new enterprise itself , only seen in this film and its predecessor , remains largely unexplored , though its exterior doesn\\'t look quite right for a reason i cannot explain . \\ndespite star trek : insurrection\\'s frequent comic goofiness and occasional substandard special effects , i enjoyed the film . \\nit maintains roddenberry\\'s largely optimistic view of the future and rejects the gritty violence of its predecessors , particularly star trek : first contact ( though , don\\'t get me wrong , the dark tones of trek films like first contact can work very successfully ) . \\ni\\'d recommend insurrection as a matinee film for a saturday afternoon , especially for fans of trek or science fiction in general . \\nrated pg , i can\\'t see this film being objectionable to the viewing audience , young or old . \\n',\n",

\\nno ? well , how about sharon stone ? \\nthought so ) . \\nif anything in this film surprises you at all , i would guess you haven\\'t seen that many films . \\nthere is no suspense here . \\ntrust me , i looked hard to find some . \\ni had to settle for contrived gimmicks and ridiculously implausible situations . \\nfincher aim\\'s for hitchcock but lands somewhere just north of joe eszterhas . \\nthere are those that might say \" the game \" is not intended to be viewed literally . \\ni would submit that is exactly the way i tried to view the film . \\nthe film simply does not have the teeth to bite into any real psychological issues . \\nthere is a moment early in the film where van orton , realizing his game has begun , smiles as he walks through the airport trying to figure out who\\'s in on the whole thing . \\nhe is charged by his paranoia . \\nhe is looking at the world through new eyes . \\nit is the last thought-provoking moment in the film . \\nfrom there on , the director only wants to stay a step ahead of us . \\nany significant archetype that is set up in the beginning of the film is simply turned into a plot device . \\nat the outset , we\\'re told each \" game \" is tailored to the individual . \\nultimately , this \" game \" is supposed to work like a crucible , trying this obscenely wealthy and emotionally detached aristocrat by fire , proving his soul . \\nyet , as douglas endures his personal gauntlet , we\\'re given very few pieces of the puzzle to illuminate us on who this man really is . \\ni wanted to like this film more than i did . \\ni look at it as just anothergreat idea , poorly realized . \\ni can think of at least two other superior films where watching the film didn\\'t mean we were seeing what was really happening . \\nbryan singer\\'s \" the usual suspects \" for one , a film that was truly unique in its ability to get you lost in the details before pulling back to show you the full masterpiece on the canvas . \\nalso , there is the underrated \" jacob\\'s ladder , \" with tim robbins , a film that really has to be watched twice before you recognize the significance of all its symbolism . \\nhere are two examples of films that don\\'t simply manipulate for manipulations\\' sake . \\nthere are films that use their labyrinth structure to lead us to a meaningful place . \\none major issue that comes up in \" the game \" is whether or not the whole \" illusion \" is just a highly sophisticated con game . \\nwell , i can tell you right now , after you\\'ve spent your $7 dollars , you may be asking yourself the same thing . \\n',\n",

       " b\"this is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st . \\nelsewhere for several years , and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also . \\ni am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations , nor were they satisfactory . \\nif i had to list a reason why . . . . \\nbut that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides , it's not immediately clear , as there are so many problems with the film . \\nadam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic , cynical , and somewhat abrasive , but a good teacher . \\nhe spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court . \\none day , he meets a drifter ( david morse , who plays jack morrison on st . \\nelsewhere ) in the park , and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball . \\nmorse turns out to be good , and a friendship slowly develops between the two , as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkin's teaching , and morse's selling of paper flowers to passing motorists . \\nso far , my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue , and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack . \\ngood music to be sure , but it doesn't replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic , a technique i rarely admire . \\nsuddenly their friendship is interrupted by morse's introduction to a fellow teacher of arkin's , a woman arkin has long admired from afar , but it too reticent to approach . \\nit appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions , but isn't sure what to do about it--she doesn't realize that he is a drifter , and knows nothing about his past ) , and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else . \\nuntil then , i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film . \\nthe conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure . \\nthe woman , at least to me , appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didn't realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin , where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse . \\nsomehow , this is made to appear as if it is arkin's fault , and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that he's gotten such a find of girlfriend . \\nfrankly , dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least . \\nafter this , the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural . \\nif i had to summarize a major gripe , it's that this is a story spread too thin , that creates semi-likable characters at the outset , and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment . \\nit might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesn't mean * i * have to like it . \\ni don't . \\n . \\navoid . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i am a steven seagal fan . \\ni only say this now because \" mufti splenetik \" isn\\'t my real name and because i probably need to explain why i went into this film expecting great things . \\nany proud seagal fan worth his beans will tell you that the seagal formula is something you can depend on . \\nseagal films can always be counted on for minimal dialogue , heaps of expendable baddies with extemely crunchable bones ( which we\\'ll always hear when seagal does his limb-twisting thing ) , rarely a female co-lead in sight ( unless it\\'s a real-life model-wife who hasn\\'t worked since weird science ) and , usually the worst possible titles you can imagine . \\nnot to mention very straightforward plots , generally all-round bad dialogue and mr implacable leather-face himself in that same black outfit he\\'s been in since nico doing his \" my hands are sharp , nimble knives \" thing , seagal the stoic , sir petrified ponytail , duke of dull . \\nin the glimmer man , seagal breaks out of this formula : he gets a * sidekick * , attempts to banter , and puts on a new vest . \\nhe\\'s also put on quite a lot of weight . \\nsmall potatoes , you may say , a man should be able to accessorize and banter if he wants to , but damnit , if it ain\\'t broke , why fix it ? \\n ( more on this disappointed person\\'s dashed expectations later ) . \\nas jack cole , seagal is a homicide detective with a questionable past . \\nwhile he and his partner ( played by keenen ivory wayans ) are investigating a series of ritual killings , cole himself becomes a suspect , especially when a background check run by campbell reveals practically nothing on cole . \\nit turns out that cole is a former trained government assassin ( you just can\\'t trust these homicide detectives ) , someone whom victims used to catch just a glimpse of in the jungle before he pounced on them , and hence , well , you know , that \" glimmer man \" thing . \\nan increasingly fishy homicide investigation in the present soon leads to the gradual uncovering of a larger , more threatening conspiracy that involves a crooked businessman ( bob gunton ) , cole\\'s former cia boss ( brian cox ) and deals involving chemical weapons . \\nthe glimmer man plot is pretty standard stuff , drawing ( as with his other films ) elements from the hotter films of the year ( eg , se7en ) . \\nit\\'s the other changes that disappoint . \\nfor example , although there\\'s a fair amount of violence in this movie , there\\'s also the disastrous pairing of seagal with keenen ivory wayans , probably the best known of the wayans tribe ( how many are there , exactly ? ) from television\\'s \" in living colour . \" \\nwayans plays whiney straightman to seagal\\'s bead-adorned and brocade-draped cole , keeping up his \" are you crazy \" part of the dialogue with wasted zest . \\nas campbell , wayans confines himself to bemoaning his new partner\\'s eccentric habits , but the chemistry between the two is minimal , and seagal\\'s wooden comebacks make for painful watching . \\na cook in under seige 2 , seagal is now a buddhist who speaks chinese and wears prayer beads and intricate silk jackets over his normal black ensemble . \\nhe chants , refuses to fight unless truly provoked and introduces campbell to powdered deer penis to cure his allergies . \\nagain , a benign ( if trite ) plot device except for the fact that these new character traits require seagal to speak more than usual . \\nheck , he has to deliver punchlines and carry a steady conversation with someone other than himself for a large part of the film . \\nis that a lot to ask of the seague ? \\ntoo much . \\nseagal\\'s best characteristic used to be that he knew his purpose in this already complicated world of movies : to crunchily snap off bad guy appendages , and to do it silently , and alone . \\nnot for seagal , the snappy one-liners of arnold and stallone , nor the attempts to show that he can act , much less think . \\nno kindergarten cop , no oscar , just simple , unadulterated deathblows . \\nthat\\'s really how it must have started : like-minded fans who knew what they wanted streamed in to watch the seague do his thing , knowing that never in the seagal universe would they ever have to see him do anything else . \\nwe trusted him . \\nwe got to know him . \\nnow , betrayal . \\ni don\\'t know if i can watch another seagal movie without that little niggling doubt that he\\'s going to try to be funny again . \\ni\\'ll try , but it won\\'t be easy . \\nif you haven\\'t watched the glimmer man yet , you might want to wait for the video to come out . \\nit\\'s easier to just fast forward the dialogue parts and linger on the action sequences . \\nafter all , if we can\\'t depend on our fantasies , what can we depend on ?

the fresher , the better . \\nwhen horner scouts a fresh faced stud bussing tables at his favorite discotheque , he decides to add him to his stable . \\nit is a pairing that leads to a meteoric rise and fall for a young man reaching his prime and an old man rapidly speeding past his . \\nas directed by anderson , the camera moves through many of the scenes with an eerie omnipresence and an almost childlike curiosity to peer beyond the closed door . \\nboogie nights provides a voyeuristic peep into the underbelly of l . a . \\'s hardcore film scene . \\nbut the peep show doesnut let us walk away when the titillation ends . \\nthe downside of voyeurism is sometimes we end up seeing things we wish we hadnut . \\nby the film\\'s final image , what we we once found titillating has now become a grim reminder of the vanity of fame and the high price of realizing your dreams . \\nboogie nights is not about sex . \\nit does not glorify porn or the lifestyles of the performers . \\nin fact , the film isn\\'t really about pornography at all . \\npornography is merely the setting to tell a compelling story about a lost and forgotten group of people who form their own sub-culture to find acceptance of who they are . \\nthe film goes to brilliant , often hilarious and sometimes harrowing lengths to show us that the people who choose to produce or perform in these films are generally not all that bright and lack the basic tools to function in the mainstream world . \\nyet , like in the lauded tarantino films , these people still have their own moral code , their own concepts of integrity and their own needs to experess themselves creatively . \\nthe characters we meet are like a road map of dysfuntion . \\nfirst stop , the den mother ( julianne moore ) in denial about her addiction to cocaine as she tries to retain custody of her son . \\nsecond stop , the cuckold crewman ( william h . macy ) who keeps discovering his wife having sex with anyone and everyone ( the wife is played in hilarious cameos by real-life porn star nina hartley ) . \\nbut the driving force behind the plot is 17 year old eddie adams . \\neddie is blessed with a natural endowment so famous that people actually pay just to see it . \\nwith no real ambition of his own , he hooks up with jack horner to fullfill his destiny of fame . \\nhis alcoholic mother , clearly dissatisfied with her own lot , abuses him verbally and drives him out of the house . \\nhorner introduces him to amber waves ( moore ) who immediately adopts him , a nuclear family is born . \\nthe surrogate relationship that develops between amber waves and her \" babies \" provides some of the films most poignant scenes . \\nclearly , she is not even fit to manage her own life , let alone nurture these lost children . \\nbut the need to love and be loved is so strong , they easily ignore the dangers of the less subtle addiction she introduces them to . \\neven the viewer is somehow lulled into feeling like the love she offers is similar to being in a real family . \\nthen again , perhaps its not so different from real families at all . \\neddie adams , who later takes on the screen name \" dirk diggler \" , is skillfully acted by former pop-star , mark wahlberg . \\ni say \" former \" pop star because with this performance wahlberg can officially quit his day job . \\nthis is bold and brave territory for such a young man . \\nhe pulls it off marvelously . \\nwahlberg is a \" big , bright star \" with a big bright future . \\nboogie nights plays very much in the spirit of the people versus larry flynt , without the first amendment preachiness . \\nits intimate studies of character make it the superior film . \\nwahlberg\\'s surprising performance is on par with woody harrelson\\'s . \\nbut in my opinion , boogie nights , is not the best film of the year . \\ni got the feeling that itus 2 1/2 hour running time could have been cut by 15 or 20 minutes without losing any of its resonance . \\nstill , if the subject matter of this film intimidates you , thereus no doubt that once you start watching boogie nights you may still feel like its not your thing , but youull find yourself grooving to it anyway . . . ya \\nknow , kinda like disco . \\n',\n",

by contrast , kennesaw's is 122 and braxton's is 102 ) . \\nthe setting is a police interrogation room where a lie detector test is about to be administered . \\nover three days , as wayland returns to answer more questions , the drama and tension among these three characters gradually escalates until , inevitably , it boils over . \\nother plot elements are thrown in for good measure . \\nwayland suffers from a peculiar kind of epilepsy that can , in stressful situations , render him virtually catatonic or extremely violent . \\nbraxton , a compulsive gambler , is deep in debt to a local syndicate . \\nand kennesaw is haunted by a dark , abusive side that delights in terrorizing women , especially his wife ( rosanna arquette ) , whom he suspects of being unfaithful . \\nthe foibles and failings of these three are brought into the open as the mystery around elizabeth's death deepens and it becomes unclear who has the upper hand : the suspect or his questioners . \\ndeceiver , which mostly transpires in a dimly-lit room and involves a lot of smart dialogue , has the feel of a david mamet play : edgy , claustrophobic , and tense . \\nthe atmosphere is explosive , and some of pivotal moments of confrontation are riveting . \\ndeceiver has the power to grab an audience . \\nunfortunately , in the end , it succumbs to the need to throw in one last , unexpected twist , and this is its undoing . \\nfor , while this surprise will certainly shock most viewers , it also stretches our credulity too much , and raises more questions than it answers . \\nit's only an effective wrap-up if you don't think too carefully about its full implications . \\nof course , the film as a whole plays fast and loose with reality and logic . \\npolice procedure is totally ignored and it's almost impossible to accept that any criminal investigation would or could proceed in this manner . \\nbut the real focus in deceiver is on character interaction , not plot details . \\ndeceiver only occasionally gets out of the police station , and those instances occur primarily during flashbacks featuring the prostitute . \\nthe pates employ a number of interesting techniques to present vignettes from elizabeth's final days and hours . \\nthe most intriguing of these is to use an unreliable narrator while underlining the discrepancies in his voice-over by visually showing what really happened . \\nmoments like this are too effective to be dismissed as gimmicks . \\nthe movie , obviously fashioned in the manner of classic film noir , drips atmosphere . \\nthere are some fascinating stylistic touches ; for example , although the setting is contemporary , all of the telephones are old-fashioned , rotary models . \\ncinematographer bill butler is given an opportunity to use unconventional camera work to liven up deceiver's look . \\nsome of the things he tries ( mostly those that involve the contrast between light and shadow ) work exceptionally well , while others ( like any of several lazy susan shots ) seem more like unnecessary visual tricks . \\nas wayland , tim roth gives the film's top performance , despite occasionally treading the tightrope between acting and overacting . \\nroth makes us believe that wayland is both as brilliant and as troubled as he's supposed to be . \\nthe other two leads , chris penn and michael rooker , aren't as effective . \\nboth play their characters like familiar types . \\npenn's performance is uninspired ; rooker's lacks subtlety . \\nsome of the best work is turned in by the supporting actors . \\nrenee zellweger , in a role that's miles away from her star-making turn in jerry maguire , brings a note of vulnerability and humanity to a part that could easily have become a caricature . \\nrosanna arquette is solid as kennesaw's wife , and michael parks delivers several wonderful scenes as a psychiatrist who's entrusted with evaluating wayland's condition . \\none of the best things about deceiver is that it never talks down to the audience . \\nplot points aren't hammered home , and , although the ending has its weaknesses , everything isn't spelled out in bold letters . \\nthe pates give audience members credit for having brains , which is an increasingly rare characteristic for film makers . \\noccasionally gripping and never uninteresting , deceiver is a fine noir effort . \\n\",\n",
       " b'when walt disney pictures announced a live-action feature based on the \\'60s cartoon series of \" mr . magoo , \" special interests groups representing the vision-impaired let out a cry of dismay . \\nmr . \\nmagoo , they claimed , would be an insult to the men and women they represented . \\nin fact , they were wrong . \\nmr . \\nmagoo is not just an insult to the blind and near-blind , it\\'s an insult to every human being who has the misfortune to suffer through this dreadfully unfunny , 90 minute atrocity . \\nit\\'s stating the obvious to remark that disney appears to have run out of original ideas . \\nlook at their roster of 1996 and 1997 releases , and you\\'ll see a shocking list of retreads , including 101 dalmatians , george of the jungle , jungle2jungle , that darn cat ! , flubber , and now mr . \\nmagoo . \\nthe best of these ( george of the jungle ) was mildly entertaining . \\nthe worst , mr . \\nmagoo , exposes just how painful a bad movie experience can be . \\nthe first problem with mr . \\nmagoo is the script . \\ndespite the collaboration of naked gun scribe pat proft , mr . \\nmagoo is comically barren . \\nfrom beginning to end , there\\'s not a laugh to be found . \\nevery attempt at humor -- and there are lots of them -- falls flat with an audible thud . \\nyou\\'d think that out of the dozens of gags jammed into this film , at least a few would work , but that\\'s not the case . \\ni\\'ve had more laughs during ingmar bergman pictures . \\nthen there\\'s leslie nielsen , who looks , sounds , and acts absolutely nothing like the animated character ( memorably voiced by jim backus ) . \\nin the past , nielsen has proven his comic aptitude with roles in movies like airplane and the naked gun . \\nlately , however , he has been getting lazy , taking parts in the likes of dracula : dead and loving it , spy hard , and mr . \\nmagoo . \\neven if nielsen was in top form , it would take an incredible stretch of imagination to see him as magoo ( especially since we\\'re reminded of the original by the short cartoon segments that open and close the film ) , but \" top form \" is not a phrase i would use to describe his performance here . \\nthis is strictly a take-the-money-and- run operation . \\nthe story , which , like many disney stories , can be described in one long sentence : magoo is the only witness to the theft of a rare jewel from a museum , and , as he is trying to apprehend the thieves on his own , the police mistake him for the robber . \\nthe cops are played by ernie hudson and stephen tobolowsky , who take their lumps early and often . \\nthe bad guys are kelly lynch ( who does a lot of martial arts-type kicking ) , nick chinlund , and malcolm mcdowell ( who has the good sense to look embarrassed ) . \\nmatt keeslar portrays one of magoo\\'s sidekicks -- his nephew , waldo . \\nthe bumbling man\\'s other , more interesting companion is a dog named angus . \\nmost of mr . \\nmagoo\\'s humor comes in the form of failed slapstick . \\nthe cartoon violence level in this film doesn\\'t approach that of home alone 3 or flubber , but it\\'s still pretty acute , with characters getting hit on the head with sledgehammers and knocked off snowy precipices . \\nthere\\'s a non-violent bit with magoo preparing a chicken dinner that could have been funny if it was handled better , but , compared to mr . bean\\'s recent , similar misadventure , it doesn\\'t hold up well . \\nthen there is the series of lame jokes that result from magoo\\'s near blindness , such as the occasion when he mistakes a wild animal for a baby . \\ni\\'m willing to cut director stanley tong a little slack . \\ntong , a hong kong film maker trying to break into the hollywood market , has helmed several jackie chan movies , including first strike , rumble in the bronx , and supercop . \\nhis chief talent , that of choreographing martial arts fights , is wasted here ( despite some high kicking by kelly lynch ) . \\nlike john woo ( hard target ) and ringo lam ( maximum risk ) before him , it appears that tong has been consigned to the purgatory of making a bad movie as his entry into the american mainstream . \\nit is worth noting that , unlike many disney films which hold a perverse appeal for the under-10 crowd while driving parents to distraction , mr . \\nmagoo appears to bore viewers of all ages . \\nthe screening i attended was wall-to-wall kids , and , for the most part , they didn\\'t seem to be enjoying themselves . \\nwhen the film was over , i asked one little girl what she thought of it . \\nher pained expression confirmed the adage that a picture can indeed be worth a thousand words . \\nmr . \\nmagoo is the kind of movie that should be rejected by any potential viewer , sight unseen . \\n',\n",
       " b'jacques tati\\'s 1953 classic \" les vacances de m . hulot \" ( also known as \" mr . hulot\\'s vacation , \" in english ) ought to be the textbook on how to do non ? dialogue comedy in film . \\nthe characters hardly ever speak to each other directly , and the film operates on the paper ? thin premise that monsieur hulot , played by tati himself , is awkward and clumsy and generally manages to annoy the other guests at the beach resort hotel where he is taking a week\\'s vacation . \\nyet the film had me beside myself laughing more consistently than any in recent memory . \\npart of the reason the film works so well is the clever setup for the various gags . \\nslapstick has often been regarded as an unsophisticated and even crude form of comedy , but i think part of the reason for this is that it often seems forced : you can only see movie characters start running after something and then crash face-first into a pole so many times before you start to wonder what all these poles are doing there in the first place or why these people don\\'t watch where they\\'re going . \\nin \" les vacances de m . hulot , \" the gags build upon each other and often start out relatively low-key . \\nin one sequence , for example , hulot is painting the side of his small row boat on the beach when , while his back is turned , the paint can gets caught up in the oncoming waves , washes away , then comes back up on the other side of the boat . \\nwhile crossing over to get the can , hulot steps in the boat and unknowingly cracks it . \\nwhen he actually takes the boat out into the water , it breaks in half , but the two halves flip up against each other , trapping him inside as the bystanders mistake it for a shark fin and panic on the beach ensues . \\ntati doesn\\'t waste a single opportunity for humor ; scenes that might have yielded one joke in most comedies are good for at least four or five in this film . \\nit has been said that comedy relies on frustrating the audience\\'s expectations , and \" les vacances de m . hulot \" succeeds brilliantly in that area as well . \\ntati accomplishes this largely through a sort of deadpan understatement . \\nwhen hulot goes into a separate room during dinner and starts playing a record at defeaningly loud volume , no fights or shouting matches ensue ; instead , the waiter calmly walks in and shuts off the power in the room , disconnecting the record player and leaving a puzzled hulot sitting in the dark . \\ntati also uses running gags to this effect , allowing them to keep running far longer than most comedy directors would ; more often than not , we can see them coming and think , \" oh , he\\'s not going to do that again , \" but , lo and behold , he does . \\nfor example , there is a recurring joke in which hulot\\'s noisy , sputtering car engine wakes everyone in the middle of the night as an exterior shot reveals the hotel\\'s lights coming on one by one . \\nthen this image turns up again in the finale , which i will not give away other than to say that involves a lot more noise in the middle of the night than a car engine could ever produce . \\nthe ending is one of two elements that really make this a four-star film as opposed to merely an above-average , clever comedy . \\nas much as i was laughing during this film , i was thinking to myself occasionally that tati had to top himself at the end to really make this work as a complete viewing experience ; suffice it to say that he did . \\nthe other important aspect is that the film never seems disdainful of its characters . \\nit easily could have turned the tables on hulot and had the other guests exact some kind of revenge on him ; alternatively , it could have portrayed the others as humorless curmudgeons . \\ninstead , tati seems to regard his characters with cheerful amusement more than anything else and invites the audience to like them , however strange or irritating they might seem . \\n \" les vacances de m . hulot \" is not subtitled , but the dialogue is sparse and for the most part not terribly essential to the flow of events . \\nanyone with a taste for this kind of absurd humor ought to make this film their next rental from the video store . \\nnote : \" les vacances de m . hulot \" was not rated by the mpaa . \\nit would at most receive a pg rating . \\n',\n",

       " b'in zoolander , the world\\'s most successful , influential and intellectually-challenged male model derek zoolander wonders , \" is there more to life than being really really really good looking ? \" \\nobviously , the film\\'s creator and star ben stiller asked a similar question when crafting a feature-length movie out of his hilarious vh1/vogue fashion awards short-film subject : can there be more to this film than being really really really silly ? \\nno , of course not , and it never aspires to be anything more . \\nmuch like derek , zoolander is a sweet simpleton of a movie . \\nit\\'s not complex in either its social commentary or its comedy , and it never produces any gut-busting laughs ( except maybe a scene when derek\\'s model roommates all die in a tragic \" gasoline fight \" accident -- a riotously funny take-off of tommy hilfiger ads ) . \\nbut it has a satisfying handful of strong chuckles , wild characters and performances , and mildly harsh potshots at the fashion industry to keep you amused . \\nbetter yet , this exaggerated version of the original three-minute skit is only blown out to an efficient 95 minutes -- just enough time to string together its goofball plot without exhausting the gag . \\nzoolander opens with several fashion bigwigs plotting to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia , since he wants to abolish child labor in his country and thus driving up their costs . \\nfashion designer and criminal mastermind jacobim mugatu ( will ferrell ) drafts a plan to brainwash the dumbest fashion model to carry out the evil deed . \\nenter derek , whose career is slumping as newcomer hansel ( owen wilson ) takes the spotlight . \\non the trail of mugatu\\'s plot is time magazine reporter matilda jeffries ( stiller\\'s real-life wife christine taylor ) , and she\\'s hoping to use mugatu\\'s pawn derek to ultimately foil the scheme . \\nmuch like the austin powers films , zoolander relies heavily on the strength of the talent involved , and this zany comedy features some of the funniest people in entertainment today . \\nwilson is hysterical as the young , vain hansel . \\nferrell nearly steals the show from everyone as the flamboyant , freakish mugatu in the same way dr . evil upstages everyone in austin powers . \\njerry stiller -- ben\\'s dad who\\'s best remembered as frank costanza of seinfeld -- makes a priceless turn as derek\\'s slimy agent maury ballstein . \\neven ben stiller show alum andy dick shows up as a deranged , large-assed masseuse . \\nas for ben stiller , it seems his derek has one gag : he\\'s stupid , which plays out in some uproarious one-liners . \\nunfortunately , taylor seems out of place and out of her league here . \\nmaybe it\\'s just because i can\\'t stop seeing her as marcia brady ( who she played in both brady movies ) , making her unbelievable as a dowdy , brainy plain jane who hasn\\'t had sex in two years . \\nshe leaves me pining for the cynicism of janeane garofolo , who would\\'ve added real comic substance to the flimsy role . \\nwhile zoolander is hardly highbrow , its screwball humor is welcome during these trying times , especially considering the gross lack of decent pickings in the theaters these days . \\nzoolander\\'s no masterpiece , but a very worthy distraction . \\n',\n",

commodity on america\\'s video shelves . \\nhaving made over 80 films , jackie has finally succeeded in bringing his style of action-comedy to the west . \\nhis latest release , \" shanghai noon \" , is a joyful tribute / spoof of the classic western . \\nand by adding jackie chan into the genre , the tag line for the film ( \" the western gets a kick in the pants \" ) rings true . \\njackie stars as chon wang , a lesser imperial guard in the forbidden city of china . \\nthe royal princess pei pei ( lucy liu ) is set to be married to the obnoxious son of a nobleman from another prefecture . \\nunwilling to follow her father\\'s wishes , princess pei pei with the assistance of her english tutor , decides to escape to america . \\nbut this is all a ploy devised by exiled guard lo fong ,

rong guang yu , and eric chen ) are ordered to transport the ransom payment to lo fong in carson city , nevada . \\nchon wang pleads with the imperial court and is given permission to join the team , as he is looked upon as a buffoon . \\non a train in the u . s . jackie meets up with bandit roy o\\'bannon ( owen wilson ) . \\nhe is much less of a bandit than he is a glory hog , looking simple for the notoriety and fame that being a bandit will bring him . \\nwith his gang in tow , roy attempts to rob the train , when one of his gang murders the chinese interpreter of the royal court , who also happens to be chon wang\\'s uncle . \\nchon wang gives chase , foiling the attempted robbery , but also leaving himself stranded in the desert . \\nas the disgraced guard wanders through the desert , he again comes upon roy , who has been left for dead by his former gang . \\nburied up to his neck in the desert , roy pleads with chon to dig him out . \\nchon demands to know where carson city is . \\nroy directs him , and chon leaves . \\nbut not before sticking two chopsticks into roy\\'s mouth and telling him to dig himself . \\nchon soon finds himself confronted by angry crow warriors , a friendly sioux tribe , gunslingers , a horse that thinks and behaves like a dog and an indian bride ( brandon merrill ) , before once again running into roy . \\n \" shanghai noon \" is just good fun . \\nthe chemistry between the cast is remarkable . \\nthe performances are all acceptable within the whimsical levels of the film . \\njackie\\'s performance is as good as anything he\\'s done before . \\nhe\\'s not called on to do much acting here , as the character is not written with any depth . \\nbut jackie\\'s natural charisma shines through , and his comic timing is so perfect , both physically and ( surprise ) verbally that once again he commands the screen whenever he is on . \\nowen wilson , last seen in the embarrassing remake of \" the haunting \" , gives a good natured performance as roy o\\'bannon . \\nhis innocence is refreshing and fun . \\na bad guy that\\'s not really bad . \\nhis scenes with jackie are some of the best bits of comic dueling since martin and

but finds a greater cause as a result of her own imprisonment . \\nthe rest of the performances are all broadly drawn comic performances . \\nnothing here is realistic , mind you . \\n \" shanghai noon \" is first and foremost a light , jovial film . \\nand the performances match that style with ease . \\nthe cinematography by dan mindel is gorgeous . \\nusing calgary , alberta as the prime location . \\nmr . mindel is able to create a lush , romantic western feel to the film . \\nnothing here really looks like nevada , but the locations are so beautifully shot and staged , the film can be looked upon as a loving tribute to earlier films of the genre . \\nand as such , the script by alfred gough and miles millar plays fast and loose with history , but with reverence to past films . \\nhomage to such films as \" high noon \" ( obviously ) , \" red river \" and most notably \" butch cassidy & the sundance kid \" all bring a sense of nostalgia to the film . \\nit is a comforting experience . \\nat a time when the western is considered either old hat or irrelevant , here is a film that embraces those old attitudes and ( dare i say ) clich ? s and manages to make them palatable and refreshing . \\nhere is a film that is not contemptuous of the genre . \\nthis is the purest \" horse opera \" since the days of george o\\'brian or john wayne . \\ndirector tom dey has crafted a loving tribute to hollywood\\'s past . \\nin this , his first film mr . dey shows both a love of character and of craftsmanship that is refreshing to see . \\nnothing here really stands out , or takes one\\'s attention away from the story or action . \\nand that is as it should be , when jackie chan is your star . \\nand what of the action and stunts . \\nwell , while not up to a level of \" drunken master 2 \" or any of jackie\\'s hong kong films , \" shanghai noon \" is miles ahead of anything jackie has done in an american film before . \\nhis timing , choreography , and creativity are still as sharp as ever . \\njackie even gets to recreate a few scenes from his earlier films ( obvious to those of us that have seen those films , but refreshingly fun for those unfamiliar ) . \\nfinally jackie can honestly say , that he has made an u . s . , his way and incorporating his style . \\nto sum up , \" shanghai noon \" is a fun summer confection . \\nnot too heavy and not too light . \\na fun and entertaining film that the whole family can enjoy ( parents be advised there are scenes of smoking , drunkenness and peyote use ) . \\nan enjoyable and charming film that can and

       " b\"when the film features richard lynch in the role of chief villain , you know that you can expect nothing more than a b grade action movie . \\nhowever , since this film also featured michael madsen , more than capable character actor , this time in the role of protagonist , the author of this review decided to give the film some benefit of the doubt . \\nhowever , the very first scenes show clear b grade action credentials - madsen plays richard montana , tough policeman who raids a drug warehouse and make life miserable for local crime lord mario gio ( played by lynch ) . \\nhowever , the raid was only partially successful , and montana is getting the rap . \\nso , he begins his own private war against gio , trying to penetrate his organisation pretending to be corrupt . \\nin the process , he meets gio's mistress gina zamora ( played by rosie vela ) and starts relationship with her too . \\nalthough it doesn't stink like many of the similar films can , inside edge is mostly forgettable b grade action routine . \\nnobody in this film actually puts much effort , including madsen or lynch , and this is especially case with uninspired screenwriter william tannen or director warren clarke . \\nthe only not so forgettable element in this film is presence of former supermodel rosie vela , who , apart from showing her more than impressive looks , shows some of the singing talent too . \\nhowever , this isn't reason enough for viewers to spend hour and half watching a film that they would , in most likelihood , forget the next day . \\n\",\n",

       " b'seen september 5 , 1998 at 10 p . m . at the sony nickelodeon theaters ( boston , ma ) , theater #2 , with matt perreault for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : okay seats , sound , and picture] \\nmodern society is now inundated with more sex and sexuality than it ever has been before , from teenage sitcoms to nc-17-rated films about fetishes . \\nthe biggest debate of the subject is whether or not it affects reality or just reflects it . \\n \" your friends and neighbors \" takes a different approach as it\\'s a film that revolves almost entirely around sex and how can be used for both pain and pleasure even within a small circle of friends . \\none of the most important aspects of the film that most be noted and analyzed before the film can really be dissected as a whole is writer/director neil labute\\'s basic setup and some of the unique methods he employs to tell the story . \\nfirstly , and most importantly is the fact the script tells a rather complex , detailed story of lust , betrayal , arrogance , hypocrisy , greed , and just plain stupidity between six different characters ( three men , three women ) , without hardly any supporting characters , ( a few have a line or two ) , mostly extras . \\neverything they do will somehow affect another character and ultimately come full-circle back to themselves , whether it be positive or negative . \\nbut to just state this is arbitrary , and explaining and criticizing the process is difficult . \\nlabute\\'s ability to tell his story through a few characters is a remarkable feat , but what\\'s specifically impressive is the fact the characters\\' names are never revealed until the end credits roll . \\nfor the sake of this review , i will describe the characters and refer to them as their main characteristic . \\nanother interesting accomplishment is the fact every scene takes place inside with limited focus . \\nwe\\'re always able to tell where the characters are ( someone\\'s home , the gym , a restaurant , hotel room , etc . ) , but what the city they live in , what year it is , what the society is like , etc . is relatively unknown . \\nthe film is a complete character study with the tight , intense drama of the theater . \\nno one plot dominates the story , which makes the first act a bit tedious for its lack of background . \\nwe\\'re simply dropped in on the characters\\' lives and are expected to figure out the rest . \\nthe characters are a group of middle-class white people who are all successful at what they do , but they\\'re only concern right now seems to be their sex lives . \\nfirst there\\'s barry ( eckhart ) and mary ( brenneman ) , a married couple who are going through a dry spell not unlike many other couples in other situations who don\\'t know what they\\'re problem is . \\nbarry is kind of a dorky businessman who loves his wife , and the sex they have , but doesn\\'t have a lot of ambition - he just follows everyone else . \\nmary is a writer of some sort , but lacks aggression and emotion like her husband and is the meekness character , but ironically , doesn\\'t hesitate to commit adultery just to feel something . \\nlabute\\'s script does a good job in characterizing mary and barry as individuals , but is very light on chemistry and connection between the two . \\nobviously , this is the theme , which is enhanced by the actors\\' good performances , but at the same time seems just a bit hollow . \\nanother couple is jerry ( stiller ) and terri ( keener ) who live together and seem to have been involved with each other for a long time , yet they constantly argue over anything and everything . \\ntheir sex life is also fraught with problems and for some reason they continue to do it throughout their infidelitous relationship . \\nif only one aspect of the film could use improvement , it would be this area . \\nit\\'s natural for a married couple to become bored with each other , but why would two people who can barely stand each other continue to have sex and live together ?

       " b\"the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \\na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \\nwhy ? \\nit's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun . \\nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \\nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \\nthe catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live . \\ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \\nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \\nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \\nin this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \\nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \\nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . \\nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \\ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \\nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \\nmst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \\nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \\noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \\nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \\nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \\nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \\nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \\nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \\nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i must admit that i was a tad skeptical of \" good will hunting \" , based both on the previews and the first fifteen minutes of the film , in which the main character will hunting ( matt damon ) , an mit janitor in his early twenties , is discovered to be an einstein-level closet genius when he solves two extraordinarily difficult math problems overnight . \\nthe only problem is that will is a tough street kid who\\'s had his share of run-ins with the law , and before long he\\'s being hauled in for assault after a parking lot fight . \\nprofessor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) , who had brought up the math problems in his lectures , tracks him down and strikes a deal with the police : will is to be released , provided he works with lambeau on his math research regularly and attends therapy sessions . \\nthis sounds like the formula for mildly charming fluff , but \" good will hunting \" rises above its fairly mundane premise to deliver a poignant and clever drama . \\na conflict gradually emerges between lambeau and will\\'s therapist sean mcguire ( robin williams ) - lambeau wants to get will to use his brain , while sean wants him to listen to his heart , both of which he has been largely neglecting . \\nwill finds that the former is much easier than the latter , so much so , in fact , that he gets bored with it and grows increasingly resistant to lambeau\\'s attempts to recruit him into the academic lifestyle . \\nhe also has his share of problems with his girlfriend skylar ( minnie driver ) , an mit student who is moving to california at the end of the school year and would like a reluctant will to come with her . \\nwhat makes \" good will hunting \" work so well , aside from the strong performances ( especially from damon and williams ) , is the depth of characterization and the representation of the conflicts in will\\'s life . \\nthe script\\'s sympathies seem to lie more with sean mcguire than with lambeau , but neither of them is presented as completely right or wrong . \\nlambeau , while he may seem a little cold at times , is still written well enough that we like him as a character even when we\\'re not sure if we like what he has to say . \\nand sean , for all his warm-heartedness , has , as lambeau and later will point out , not lived up to his full intellectual potential either ; the therapy sessions turn out to be just as revelatory for sean as they do for will . \\nwill\\'s reaction to this situation , and the way in which he slowly becomes more receptive to skylar and to sean , is presented in a believable fashion and in a way that forces the audience to consider all the characters\\' opinions , rather than setting up an obvious \" right \" and \" wrong \" side and beating them over the head with it . \\nfor a film with such an extraordinary character , \" good will hunting \" presents itself as remarkably ordinary ; it achieves the difficult task of making the next albert einstein into an everyman , a character to whom the audience can easily relate and who must make choices similar to those that almost everyone faces at one time or another . \\nthis film gives us real drama when it so easily could have given us merely melodrama , by having the government kidnap will to use him in covert spy missions or introducing some other equally far-fetched situation . \\n \" good will hunting \" also has its share of fun humor , such as when will , in an early therapy session , pretends to be hypnotized and smoothly parodies the alien abduction scenarios that have become so well known in popular culture . \\nand in the one scene in which government agents do in fact appear , will blows them off with a hilariously scathing accusation of human rights violations in africa . \\nwill\\'s relationship with his friends , most notably chucky ( ben affleck ) , is usually rather amusing , if somewhat crude ( the film has 100+ uses of the \\'f\\' word , which was most likely the reason for its r-rating ) , and lends itself well to the development of will\\'s character . \\nadd all this to the fact that \" good will hunting \" even manages to pull off an uplifting happy ending without getting excessively sentimental , and you might be wondering why i haven\\'t given this film four stars . \\nwell , for one thing , no matter how well damon and affleck , who wrote the screenplay , and director gus van sant pull it off , the story is still rather contrived and not particularly original . \\nthere are also a few scenes that did feel a bit formulaic , including one that was supposed to be emotional but really just seemed like the obligatory crying scene for any movie involving therapy sessions . \\nstill , \" good will hunting \" takes its premise a lot farther than i thought it would , and is definitely one of the better personal dramas i have seen in the last few years , and as of right now it stands as one of the top five on my list of \\'97 films . \\n',\n",

       " b'there\\'s good news and bad news about mulan . \\nthe positive is that disney has found a happy medium between the heavy-handedness of pocahontas and the hunchback of notre dame and the childishness of hercules . \\non the other hand , the studio is pulling out all the stops on plot cliches and cheap laughs , several steps down from the days of the little mermaid and beauty and the beast . \\nbut mulan is a step in the right direction and disney\\'s best animated feature since the lion king . \\nafter giving native americans a turn in pocahontas , disney has decided to turn a movie over to the asians . \\nmulan is set in feudal china and features the ever-popular heroine who marches to a different drum and wants to do more with her life than get married . \\nthat\\'s what we find out when young mulan ( voice of ming- na wen ) screws up her appointment with the matchmaker by letting a rogue cricket splash coffee all over her . \\ncartoons . . . \\nmeanwhile , word comes from the emporer that one man from every family must join the army and help fight the huns . \\nsince mulan\\'s a girl , that means her decrepit old father must go . \\nshe pleads with the soldiers to have mercy on dear old dad , but that kind of groveling and desperation brings shame on her family . \\nthat\\'s chinese culture for you . . . \\nso imagine how embarrassed the family is the next day when they find mulan has stolen her father\\'s uniform and sword and run off to join the army in his place . \\nthe movie in a nutshell is about the stuggles of being a woman in the army . \\nit should have been called g . i . \\nchang . \\nmulan calls on her ancestors for help . \\nthey decide to summon the large stone dragon in the backyard to protect her , but a mini dragon named mushu screws it up . \\nvoiced by eddie murphy , mushu continues the tradition of cute talking animal sidekicks who do more slapstick harm than good for their human charges . \\nmurphy\\'s performance is a direct descendent of robin williams in aladdin -- lots of wisecracks and ad-libs and even an introductory song about how much fun they\\'re going to have . \\nyou ain\\'t never had a friend like mushu . \\nspeaking of songs , mulan doesn\\'t have too many of them , which is a plus with a story like this . \\ndisney songs about war probably wouldn\\'t go over too well ( \" heigh ho , heigh ho , it\\'s off to war i go . . . \" ) , and the ones they do have aren\\'t memorable . \\nthe best of the bunch , sad to say , is \" be a man , \" the requisite basic training montage song . \\nyes , even in medieval china , they had to run through that web of car tires before they were ready for battle . \\nsung by donnie osmond ( a bad sign if ever there was one ) , \" be a man \" accompanies footage of mulan\\'s platoon going from screw-ups to heroes . \\nit makes me wonder , has there ever been a musical montage in a movie that\\'s ended badly ? \\ni only wish real-life problems could be solved in two minutes with a peppy montage . \\nfor the curious , mulan does pass for a man in the army despite looking like a girl . \\nall she does to transform herself is cut her hair to a sexy shoulder-length , talk macho and slap guys on the butt , as was male custom a thousand years ago in china . \\nthe deception fools everyone but the audience , who thinks she might be able to pass for a 12-year-old boy , at best . \\nbut she does manage to strike the biggest blows to the hun army , led by a big , evil-eyed attilla-looking monster . \\nas a villain , the head of the huns is menacing , evil and entirely forgettable . \\ni saw the movie yesterday and i don\\'t remember the man\\'s name . \\notherwise , mulan is a good movie . \\nthe animation of the characters themselves isn\\'t as rich as it could and should be , but there are some amazing battlefield shots . \\neddie murphy pulls off some good one-liners , as do other star voices like harvey fierstein and pat morita , the quintessential asian movie star . \\nhell , george \" mr . sulu \" takei does a voice in mulan . \\nyou get the sense disney said to themselves , \" alright , let\\'s get out there and find us some chinese americans in hollywood . \\nwho can you think of ? \" \\n \" well , there\\'s mr . myagi . . . \" \\n \" good . \" \\n \" and mr . sulu . \" \\n \" perfect . \\nwe\\'ve got ourselves a movie now . \" \\nsoon disney really _will_ be able to paint with all the colors of the wind . \\n',\n",
       " b'here is a film that is so unexpected , so scary , and so original that it caught me off guard and threw me for a loop . \\nokay , it isn\\'t quite original , considering it is a sequel to the box office hit species , but it certainly is smart . \\nmost films of this genre are reminiscent of those cheesy b-horror films from the 50s and 60s , and some even become them . \\nhowever , as we learned with the 1995 small-budget horror/sci-fi film , sometimes expectations can be shattered . \\na lot of criticism has gone against this film ( from what i have read so far , anyway--yep , all two reviews ) , and it makes me wonder why these types of films are automatically dismissed as gory , laughable pieces of trash . \\nbut , the thing is , it isn\\'t . \\nit\\'s well made , well acted , and quite intelligent . \\ni can see most of the critics now complaining about the level of gore or the level of sexuality in the film . \\nbut the species series isn\\'t about the lack of these elements . \\nit\\'s about how much it can get into one film . \\nand yet , behind it all , it has this basic premise that allows it to get away with doing so . \\nspecies ii begins in the present day , though it seems to be an alternate universe . \\nmany films ( especially sci-fi ones ) create similar timelines as our realistic one , but change it to fit the film\\'s needs . \\nspecies ii begins with the arrival of an american spacecraft , the excursion , landing on the surface of mars . \\naboard is patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , a very bright and very handsome astronaut . \\npatrick is the son of senator ross ( james cromwell ) , who just wants patrick to succeed . \\nwell , it would seem that he has succeeded . \\nlanding on the surface of mars , he is the first human being to ever do so . \\nof course , he isn\\'t the first ever . \\nabout a billion years ago , an alien species supposedly landed on mars and destroyed the perfect living conditions that were able to sustain life . \\nnow , of course , the red planet is cold and rocky . \\nno life lives on it . \\nthat is , no visible life . \\npatrick , upon leaving the spacecraft and landing on the red soil , collects samples from the ground . \\nhe takes them aboard , and puts them in storage . \\nunfortunately , one of the samples contains a form of life , and it gets loose when it is heated aboard the ship . \\njust prior to heading back to earth , this life form creeps along the floor and inhabits the earthlings . \\nthey pass out for approximately seven minutes , and then shrug it off as nothing , because they can\\'t even remember . \\nthey blame it on a technical malfunction . \\nback on earth , patrick begins to have strong urges to mate with as many women as possible . \\nas we know from the original , this is because the alien wants to breed and take over the planet . \\nhowever , the children that are bred are half-human , as their father is . \\npatrick is really looking for another alien to breed with , and he finds it in eve ( natasha henstridge ) . \\neve was cloned from dna taken from sil , the original alien . \\nhowever , this time around , most of her \" alien \" urges have been either decreased dramatically , or lie dormant . \\nthe project is led by dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , reprising her role from species ) , and her motives seem respectable . \\nsince she was involved with the original alien attack , she wants to learn how to stop the alien should it come again . \\nand it has . \\nstory-wise , species ii is much stronger than its predecessor , but it is also much stronger than , say , aliens ( hey , i love the film , but you can\\'t tell me it was strong on story ) . \\nwhat surprised me the most with this film was the incorporation of historical facts into the screenplay . \\nin my search for extraterrestrial intelligence course in college , we learned about a piece of rock from mars which landed in one of the poles . \\nthis piece of rock contained fossils which may have been proof of life on mars ( later , it was proven that it was not a living creature that created it ) . \\nthe script uses this effectively , but also manages to provide a well-balanced plot . \\nbeginning with the first man on mars ( something i have always dreamed of seeing ) , i was hoping that the film would turn this element into a useful starting point for the movie . \\nand it does it quite well . \\nthe characters are all smart , and they know what to do and what not to do . \\nthe only character that seems a little cliched is the general ( george dzundza ) , and yet , he remains logical in everything he does . \\nthere are the obvious flaws of course , mostly lying in the technical aspects . \\nthe special effects are only mediocre , and some are just plain bad . \\nbut for the most part , they remain believable ( i even noticed a homage to the alien series when the mothers gave birth to alien children ) . \\nalso , the most realistic ones are usually the goriest , ranging from people being torn open , or someone\\'s head being blown off . \\nhowever , some plot elements also may elicit laughs from the audience , including a menage a troi that is all but necessary . \\nmany people dislike the species series because all it is is an excuse for sex , nudity , and gory violence . \\nhowever , i tend to disagree . \\nwhat were the alien films about ? \\nand , if an alien species ever did come to earth , and their sole purpose was to destroy us , wouldn\\'t you mate as quickly as possible with as many people as possible ? \\nmy only gripe with this is during the scene where patrick goes searching for a mate in a grocery store . \\ni didn\\'t realize that aliens were that picky on choosing women to mate with ( i just assume it is his part-human side looking for the most beautiful one ) . \\nthe acting is quite good for this kind of film . \\nit is a vast improvement over the first film , at least . \\nthe acting is the key element to this film : if it was bad , it would have lowered itself into camp ; if it was good , it would have asked for comparison with films like aliens . \\nokay , so it isn\\'t that good . \\ngeorge dzundza is probably the most obvious mistake on casting , as his over-the-top impersonation of a general makes him annoying and distracting . \\nnatasha henstridge is limited this time around , as she is usually enclosed in a cage . \\nhowever , she does manage a very impressive performance with this aspect hindering any of her talent . \\noh yeah , and she\\'s quite fun to just plain watch . \\nmarg helgenberger is immensely better this time around , and her performance is probably the best in this film . \\nmichael madsen is so-so , but he isn\\'t annoying , and he soon becomes rather appealing ( with his nice cynic personality ) . \\njames cromwell has a small part , but he makes it much better than what it could have been with a more incapable actor . \\nas i say , any film with james cromwell dramatically increases in likeability . \\nmykelti williamson gives an enjoyable performance , and he gives the film a more down-to-earth feel . \\nand , of course , justin lazard . \\nlazard has so far been ridiculed for his performance , but i think he is effective . \\nsure , he is wooden , but isn\\'t that what his character is like ? \\nthe moment when he touches the glass separating henstridge from him was extremely well done , due to the couple\\'s acting . \\nspecies ii is rated r for strong sexuality , sci-fi violence/gore and language . \\nthis is definitely an r rated film that young kids should not see . \\nmore than likely , they would probably have nightmares and never have sex for the rest of their lives . \\nhell , i don\\'t even know if i will . \\nwhat is sure to be a critically lambasted film turns out to be the surprise film of the year . \\ni probably won\\'t see another film where i was expecting so little and got so much for quite a while . \\ndirector peter medak has crafted a very suspenseful , and sometimes very scary movie out of a mediocre series . \\nmedak has also mastered the wonderful \" jump ! \" \\nmoments , and has probably the second scariest moment i have ever seen on film ( scream still has the first ) . \\nstrong acting , smart dialogue , intelligent plotting , and a sure-handed director , species ii is exactly what these films should be : entertaining . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" tarzan and the lost city \" is one of the most anemic movies to come out in quite a while . \\nnot only it is poorly written , badly acted , and generally incompetent in all cinematic areas , it is thoroughly uninspired and insipid . \\nunfortunately , it\\'s not bad in the way great , colossal misfires like \" heaven\\'s gate \" ( 1980 ) or \" ishtar \" ( 1987 ) were bad . \\ninstead , it literally drips off the screen like a movie nobody wanted to be associated with , which begs the question of why it was made in the first place . \\nwith all the good scripts lying around hollywood un-produced , how does needless drek like this make its way to the big screen ? \\nof course , tarzan is one of the most filmed characters in all of motion picture history - he has appeared in over forty films , which have ranged from the very good ( 1984\\'s \" greystoke : the legend of tarzan , lord of the apes \" ) down to the really bad ( 1981\\'s \" tarzan , the ape man \" with bo derek ) . \\nmost of these films were just cheapie b-movies made in the thirties and forties , starring ex-olympic athletes and a lot of cutsie chimps . \\ntherefore , if another tarzan movie is to be made , one might assume that it would have something new to offer - a different angle , an original storyline , anything to set it apart from all the others . \\n \" greystoke \" added a never-before-seen level of realism to the pulpy tale , and even \" tarzan , the ape man \" at least had the mis-guided audacity to sexualize the story as a vehicle for bo derek\\'s bare breasts . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city , \" on the other hand , has absolutely nothing to offer but a bunch of recycled storylines and bad dialogue . \\nthe script , by bayard johnson and j . anderson black is about as formulaic and generic as they come . \\ncomic books have better plots than this . \\nthe movie is so bad , in fact , that it retains that ridiculous tarzan call that was so tirelessly mocked in last summer\\'s comedy \" george of the jungle . \" \\ndidn\\'t the producers think to leave that back in the old weissmuller pictures where it belongs ? \\nthe story starts with the legend of tarzan already firmly established : a quick opening narration tells of tarzan ( casper van dien ) being found in the jungle after having been raised by apes , and his return to england where he assumes his greystoke heritage . \\nwhen the movie starts in 1913 , he is a civilized english gentleman ( without an english accent ) , and he is to marry jane ( jane march ) in less than a week . \\nhowever , when a wicked archeologist/grave-robber named nigel ravens ( steve waddington ) begins hunting for the fabled lost city of opar , one of africa\\'s last great secrets , the witch doctor of an ancient african tribe summons tarzan back to the jungle . \\nat first , jane refuses to go , pouting about how it will interfere with their wedding ; but after tarzan leaves she changes her mind and tracks him down , therefore assuring lots of lame smooch scenes between her and her ape-man . \\nonce the film gets going ( in its own sluggish way ) , it delves into a series of jungle adventures , as tarzan , jane , and the natives attempt the thwart ravens and his crew from discovering the city . \\nmost of the so-called adventures are cheesy , predictable , and unexciting , with no pace , tension , or action to speak of . \\nthere are sequences stolen from innumerable recent adventure movies , ranging from \" raiders of the lost ark \" ( 1981 ) to \" the goonies \" ( 1985 ) . \\nwhen the movie is running short on action , it includes a few greenpeace-friendly scenes of tarzan freeing caged animals , releasing a baby elephant from a trap , and throwing ivory tusks into the river . \\nthe movie is also lacking even a remote hint of reality . \\nfor instance , when tarzan - who was raised in the jungle - is bit by a cobra , he doesn\\'t even attempt to suck the venom out like any semi-experienced weekend backpacker would do . \\ninstead , he ties a tourniquet around his arm and stumbles off into the jungle with no plan for survival . \\nof course , one can\\'t help but notice how fundamentally misleading the title is . \\nnot to ruin the ending or anything , but there is no lost city . \\nthere is , however , a lost pyramid , which i suppose is all the resource-strapped fx department could come up with ( the special effects are not worthy of a made-for-tv movie ) . \\nwhich also brings up the question of why the treasure hunters had to slog through numerous underground caverns to get to the lost pyramid , when it\\'s sitting right out in the middle of an open field ? \\nstrictly speaking , \" tarzan and the lost city \" isn\\'t even bad enough to have camp quality , although casper van dien\\'s laughably stiff performance comes real close . \\nthis movie proves what \" starship troopers \" only hinted at : he cannot act , but he sure looks well-groomed , even in the deepest heart of the african jungle . \\nvan dien is much too much of a pretty-boy to be an effective tarzan ; he\\'s a calvin klein model in a loin cloth . \\ni also wondered what the make-up department was thinking when it outfitted him with that awful circa-1983 steve perry haircut . \\nwaddington makes a decent villain , although he\\'s like a charmless version of belloq from \" raiders of the lost ark . \" as jane , the ex-model jane march has little to do but smile and look pretty next to tarzan . \\nshe does fire off a gun at the evil treasure hunters a time or two , but whenever a snake comes into the picture , she is reduced to a hysterical mess . \\nhowever , amidst all this complaining , i do have one piece of good news . \\n \" tarzan and the lost city \" is so lacking in ideas both new and old , that it is unable to fill even an hour and a half of celluloid . \\nso , we can say this much for it : at least it had the decency to be short . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" it\\'s not good to know too much about someone , charlie , \" charles warns his niece , charlie ( margaret welsh ) , with a devilish grin . \\ncharlie is infatuated with her namesake uncle , her \" soul mate \" as she calls him since her mother gave her his name . \\nthere\\'s a lot to know about charles , not the least of which is that he strangled 3 widows back east . \\nmark harmon , who looks like anything but a killer but specializes in playing them , plays charles , the merry widow murderer in the 1991 hallmark hall of fame remake of the 1943 hitchcock film , shadow of a doubt . \\nand to avoid any questions about his guilt , we see charles in action in the opening scene with his last victim . \\nthe story takes place in the early 1950s in the small town of petaluma , california , where charles heads to avoid the police . \\njohn gay\\'s script uses most of the original screenplay by sally benson , alma reville , and thornton wilder . \\nkaren arthur\\'s direction is certainly no match for the great master , but on an absolute scale , the movie maintains a high level of suspense . \\nwhen supercilious and deceitful charles comes to pay a visit of indeterminate length with his sister and her family in petaluma , they don\\'t know about his nefarious activities . \\nhe showers them with elaborate gifts to buy the love they had already given him anyway . \\ntwo mysterious and exceedingly clean-cut writers for a magazine show up to take pictures of the family for a spread on the \" average american family , \" but their interest is focused on uncle charles , especially on taking his picture and learning about his background . \\ncharlie , who first welcomed her uncle\\'s visit , begins to feel more and more uncomfortable with him and suspicious of the disingenuous magazine reporters . \\nthe picture advances with a delicate power using small details such as the newspaper article that the uncle tries secretly to remove and that charlie discovers . \\nthe beauty of the story is the pas de deux between uncle and niece as they try to out psych each other . \\nshe wants him to leave , and he doesn\\'t want to go , what with a local , rich widow as a prospective victim . \\nwill charles kill charlie first , or will she get him out of town . \\nharmon is wonderfully creepy and smug , and welsh is tough but trapped . \\nwith a deft touch the director sets up each scene , several with thunderstorms , and tom neuwirth\\'s sepia-toned cinematography makes the movie feel as if it were filmed in the 50s . \\nmy only quibble is the director\\'s awkward staging of the final scene on the train . \\nis hitchcock\\'s version better ? \\nof course . \\nis this one worth watching as well ? \\nactually , yes . \\nshadow of a doubt runs 1 : 40 . \\nit is not rated but would be pg for adult themes and would be fine for kids around nine and up . \\n',\n",

       " b'i swear i have seen the edge before . \\nin fact , it reminded me of the bear , the river wild , and other various films mixed into an entirely different film . \\nhowever , the edge has done something that most action films should do , and that is add heart and characters we like to the plot . \\nin doing so , the edge draws many more suspenseful moments out of cliched scenes than , say , the peacemaker . \\nunfortunately , because of those overused moments , we can pretty much guess the outcome of the film . \\nbut leave it to screenwriter david mamet to add humor and a few surprises to mess with your head . \\none surprise , in particular , left me smiling just because mamet actually had the guts to add it to his script . \\naction films are a dime a dozen in hollywood , and while they are somewhat successful at entertaining us , they lack the one thing which would make them a more respected genre : intelligence . \\neven horror films have learned this , a genre which is probably the least respected of them all . \\nthe river wild was one of the best action/suspense films i have seen from the 90s . \\nthe intelligence of the screenplay , and the suspense drawn from the realistic characters is nearly unmatched to this day . \\nthe edge has the intelligence and smart characters , but this time the lack of originality is the downfall . \\ni must admit that it was very suspenseful , and had an original third half , but the first hour and a half is riddled with cliches and plot holes . \\nthis is an example of the final act saving the film , instead of the other way around ( as in the lost world ) . \\nif only the screenplay had maintained the final thirty minutes\\' intensity , it could have become a great action film ( and i use the term loosely ) . \\nthe edge is pretty much a survival-of-the-fittest film . \\nbut taking scream\\'s lead , the edge makes fun of the genre\\'s cliches , and then uses them ( though not quite as effectively ) . \\ncharles morse ( anthony hopkins ) is the main character , a rich and very intelligent man who wonders what the accumulation of all this knowledge has brought to him . \\nfor once , we don\\'t immediately care for the main character . \\ninstead , we like bob ( alec baldwin ) , a photographer who is going to take pictures of charles\\' wife , mickey ( elle macpherson ) , out in the wilderness . \\nthey board a plane and head to a cabin somewhere in the arctic . \\ncharles\\' birthday is the same day , and he receives a gold watch from his wife , and a pocket knife from bob . \\nas action films go , these items do have importance to the rest of the story , but quite a bit more than we first expect . \\nsoon , however , bob wants to find a native to shoot pictures of because of his \" personality . \" \\ncharles , bob , bob\\'s assistant steve ( harold perrineau ) , and the pilot head off to find him , and as shown in the previews , hit a flock of birds flying south for the winter . \\ndown the plane goes , the pilot is killed , and the three are left to survive in the wilderness . \\ndirector lee tamahori is aware of the silly plot which is about to follow , and therefore has to create original ways to approach the situations . \\nhe succeeds often enough for us to enjoy the film . \\ntake , for instance , the entire man-hunting bear plot . \\nthis has been done many times in films with different animals , and even bears . \\nbut given the charles\\' intelligence , and bob\\'s uncertainty , many of the cliches are given fresh twists . \\neven charles himself seems to have seen these action films before . \\nmy favorite line of the film comes from charles : \" most people die in the wilderness because they didn\\'t do the one thing that could save their life . . . \\nthinking . \" \\ndespite the predictability of the main plot , a subplot develops late in the film which took me by surprise , and made me smile when i realized that everything isn\\'t as it seems anymore . \\ni have to write cautiously as to not reveal this surprise , so instead i will avoid it entirely . \\nthe first two-thirds of the edge have many humorous moments to push it along , and some of charles\\' survival techniques seem possible , even making fire from ice . \\ntamahori is able to create a lot of suspense from the stalking bear , but whenever the bear is present , the characters lose all sensibility . \\ni have always wondered why characters in films walk over a log to get across water . \\nwhy not do what an intelligent person would and crawl across ? \\ni guess getting chased by a bear makes your thought process turn off for a while . \\nthankfully , we already have begun to care for the characters , and so we let this small detail slide . \\nbut some of the technical details are awkward , such as the nice stitching done on the fur coat that charles and bob make ( where did they get thread and needles ? ) . \\nthe acting of the film is highly above average for a film of this nature , and borders on phenomenal . \\nanthony hopkins gives a terrific performance , creating his most likeable and layered character since remains of the day . \\nhopkins usually brings greatness to his roles , but here he exceeds at gaining the audiences\\' sympathy , something he definitely did not do in silence of the lambs . \\nalec baldwin gives one of his best performances i have ever seen ( it sure is better from his fair game ) . \\nbaldwin can be a good or a bad character , and here he succeeds at both in a way . \\nyou can never quite guess if he is a nice or a vllainous character until the end , and baldwin is able to handle the double-natured photographer . \\nelle macpherson gives a good performance , albeit slight . \\nshe isn\\'t in the film all that much , but for the scenes she does have , she handles as an actress , not as a model . \\nharold perrineau is a good actor , and his scenes are nice and underplayed . \\nhe is eliminated early , and i reveal nothing by saying this because it is inevitable and predictable . \\nthe edge is rated r for graphic violence , some gore , and language . \\nsome of the violence is a little too disturbing , even for me . \\nthis film is a nice change from the mindless action most of us are used to , but too many cliches bog it down . \\ndirector tamahori has created a very smooth and suspenseful action film out of recycled parts . \\ndavid mamet\\'s script , though , has a lot of humor to keep the first hour afloat , and the acting is solid . \\nthe best thing about the script is the ending which doesn\\'t end with the normal high-strung action sequence , but with a small detail involving a certain gift . \\nit\\'s a nice touch considering what we have had to go through with the bear . \\nand by the way , most people laughed when the film faded to black due to a large credit to bart the bear . \\nway to go , bart . \\n',\n",
       " b'i wish i could say that there is something more to the new star wars installment than what you see in the commercials , but there isn\\'t . \\ngeorge lucas is an expert at crafting triumphant , special effects-bound flicks and he has done it again . \\nthis is the first star wars film i\\'ve seen on the big screen , so , of course , the impact was much greater than when i watched the three original episodes on video . \\nwhat is compelling about the phantom menace is not its disposable story , but its amazing visuals . \\nbasically , the film\\'s plot is centered around trade disputes between two planets . \\nqui-gon ( liam neeson ) and his young apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) set out with the animated jar-jar binks to fix the mess that may result in war . \\nwhen their ship breaks down and they are stranded , they find a young boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) and his slave mother . \\nqui-gon strongly believes that anakin is destined for jedi greatness and immediately takes him under his wing . \\nanakin participates in a heart-pounding podrace , one of the highlights of the film , to get the equipment needed to fix qui-gon\\'s ship . \\nhowever , most everyone is doubtful about entrusting the future to some unknown slave boy . \\nmeanwhile , queen amadala ( natalie portman ) is frustrated and at wit\\'s end , being na ? ve and young and having so much responsibility on her shoulders . \\nthere are hardly any emotional scenes in the film- even when we discover that anakin will be leaving his slave mother behind to begin jedi training , the frenzied excitement of the whole film wears down the poignancy to the size of a crumb . \\nthis does not prove that the phantom menace is poorly made for it is brilliantly made . \\nin all the star wars films , human emotions that we , the audience , can identify with are usually nil , but the films are for pure enjoyment , not for uplifting purposes . \\ndespite the fun of watching the movie , the phantom menace is not without flaws . \\nfor starters , we have the ill-conceived , moronic character jar-jar binks who should be considered a threat to star wars galactic society and to the audience . \\nwhat a klutz ! \\ngeorge lucas clumsily tried to create a fun character that would be as memorable as , say , yoda , r2-d2 , or c3-po , but , alas , his efforts were in vain . \\nsecondly ( this may be good or bad , depending on your point of view ) , the movie\\'s atmosphere is so different from the familiar comic-book feel of the previous three star wars installments . \\nthis is due , perhaps , to the utter complexity to this movie\\'s plot and the higher level of sophistication of the visual effects used here . \\nthe movie seems to be reaching for epic proportions . \\ni can\\'t say much about the acting , though acting has never been what you saw star wars movies for anyway . \\nhowever , there is absolutely no pizzazz to the performances- they are straightforward and , at times , stale . \\nnatalie portman has a great presence , but her turn as queen amadala makes the queen a stoic , unfeeling ? enigma . \\nthere is nothing we can hold onto in her performance to make us believe the trade predicament is anything of importance . \\njake lloyd is the only actor here who has an ounce of evident spunk . \\ndespite the inevitable faults , there is so much to enjoy about the movie . \\nthe heightened excitement of the final sequences doesn\\'t quite surpass the famous the empire strikes back climactic scenes , but they are amazing and edge-of-your-seat fun in their own rite . \\nthe film is a treasure to look at . \\nthe visual effects are astonishing 99 . 8% of the time- the awe-inspiring , mouth-opening , eye-popping sight of the underwater city is nothing short of production design and special effects genius . \\nnot since 1997\\'s the fifth element has there been a film as drenched in visual treats as this one . \\nthe production design is reminiscent of the fifth element , the previous star wars movies , kubrick\\'s 2001 , maybe even of fritz lang\\'s classic silent metropolis . \\nhowever , all the sets are so original . \\nthe original star wars movies can\\'t even match the grandeur of this film\\'s visuals and that is a sheer pleasure for the viewer- it gives us hope of even greater things for the upcoming episode . \\nthe costumes are remarkable and have jean-paul gaultier written all over them . \\nwhether its queen amadala\\'s gigantic wardrobe complete with gold-embroidery and feathers , or the jedis\\' simple brown uniforms , the costume designer has fused talent with outrageousness . \\nthe costumes are one of the true delights of watching the movie . \\nas for john williams\\' score , i don\\'t think he\\'s done one as complex or powerful since ? i can\\'t even remember . \\nit is as epic as his schindler\\'s list score and as thrilling and zestful as jaws . \\nit includes the bare bones of his music from the previous three films , but williams has added on , made the music much more intense and moving . \\nwhat with the overwhelming hoopla that circled this movie , one might come in with high expectations and be disappointed . \\nthere is very little to hate in the film : it\\'s a very accomplished and skillfully made flick . \\nit is the best \" fun \" film and the best big-budget film out today , most definitely . \\n',\n",

just can\\'t help but be totally drawn into its story and shocked by every single turn that occurs . \\ni prefer films like these because these are what the best kind of films are like . \\ni don\\'t really feel there are to be any real \" rules \" for cinema ; a film can do anything , as long as it makes it work . \\nbut i do ask that all films have one thing in common : they create experiences . \\nwhen i watch a film , no matter what kind of film it is , i want to be able to take certain memories along with me . \\n \" the celebration \" is great because it\\'s chock full of those . \\nit creates a world so completely realistic that everything that occurs is as memorable as the little instances of life that catch your attention and stay with you for the rest of your life . \\nand then it makes things just a tad bit farscial , just to make sure you\\'re paying attention , which you are because what transpires is just so goddam interesting that if you were to ever feel bored , then you\\'re of your attention span needs a bit of a tuning-up . \\nthe story takes place at the extravagant home of an aging patriarch ( henning mortizen ) , who has just turned 60 and is having a party thrown for him . \\nall his friends and family turn up , and for the first half hour , we get introduced to everyone , simplistically and realistically ( no aggravatingly condescending posing for the camera deals here ) . \\nthe eldest son , christian ( ulrich thomsen , looking a bit like a young malcolm mcdowell ) , is the first to be seen in the film , walking to his father\\'s home . \\nhis brother , michael ( thomas bo larsen ) , drives by , pulls over , greets him , then kicks his family out of the car , forcing them to walk to the estate , just so christian can be comfortable . \\nwe then meet helene ( paprika steen ) , their sister , a woman who always seems to be stressed-out , who invites the driver of her car ( gbatokai dakinah ) , an american , to to come join her at the party she\\'s going to . \\nonce they\\'re all there and settled in , the party begins , and as custom , the eldest son has to make a speech to his dad , so christian stands up , at the head of the table , and reveals the film\\'s punchline : his father raped all his children at a young age . \\nbut since this is a family/friends affair , his confession becomes more detested than the supposed truth , and is simply brushed off despite his efforts , and what transpires is sorta like jerry springer crossed with jean renoir , and it\\'s all terribly interesting to watch . \\ntwists occur , and soon the film has taken on a nearly-farsical nature , but still seems realistic because the people involved really feel like they could reach such ends . \\nthe most notorious thing about this film , which has been getting the most notice , though , is that the director , thomas vinterberg has shot it in a completely awkward fashion . \\nas a member of the danish filmmakers clan , dogme 95 , a group that has vowed to oppose \" the auteur concept , make-up , illusions , and dramaturgical predictability \" so that they may \" purge film so that once again the inner lives of the characters justify the plot . \" \\ni have not seen \" breaking the waves , \" the other notable film by a member of this group ( lars von trier , to be exact ) , but \" the celebration \" works exquisitely in this department . \\nit feels like reality , like you\\'re actually watching real people and not actors , and as a major pointer , has been shot on video . \\nas a result , it looks more like the home movies you never dare shot of your family than an actual film , but always wanted to . \\nwe see key moments in people\\'s lives that they wouldn\\'t dare show to the world , and it captures the farscial comedy of life so accurately and acutely that this style , as ironically-showmanship as it really is , works perfectly for the nature of the film . \\nthe key , though , to this film , and the reason it\\'s not just a cool danish import , is because this film is not about revealing the truth as much as it is about the way people react to such an explosive truth . \\nthroughout the film , we see a completely realized debate over the truth and the effects it has on the lives of those who have learned to live with lies , a debate so three-dimensional that it could easily blow oliver stone and his the-truth-at-all-costs reasoning out of the water . \\nof course it was not right for the father to rape his children , and of course , they couldn\\'t have fought back then , and of course this has created scarring suppression inside them . \\nand yes , it\\'s thearapeutic for one to release the truth years later , when they know it could easily destroy the one who emotionally destroyed them earlier . \\nbut then again , the father , after all , is not a totally bad guy , and we can see the emotional complications that arise thanks to a performance by mortizen which is just so great and touching that while we do believe that he could have raped his children years earlier , we also see a man who has also learned to live with what he\\'s done , and deep down , feels true guilt that is only now beginning to surface . \\nthe final scene , involving mortizen and everyone else , is utterly devastating , thanks to him and thomsen , whose performance is utterly flawless and equally emotionally complex . \\neveryone else is flawless as well - the actors never seem to be stepping into the shoes of their characters as much as they do walking comfortably in them . \\nthe actors or writers have not made the mistake to judge these characters in the slightest : there are no whites or blacks but instead all grays , exactly like life . \\nas such , \" the celebration \" may be the one truly bizarro film of the year : a work of art so eerily close to reality that it\\'s utterly disturbing and utterly fascinating . \\n',\n",

       " b'i\\'ll be the first to admit it . \\nwhen you mention the book great expectations , i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class , where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch . \\nyes , it\\'s a classic of literature , but it was a rather dry one , shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine . \\ncertainly , the experience wasn\\'t truly that bad , but , to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book , \" i\\'m not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . i\\'ll \\ngonna tell it the way i remember it . \" \\nanyway , to return from nostalgia lane , and get back to the present , hollywood , in it\\'s trendy attempt to modernize the classics , now presents an updated film version of great expectations . \\ninstead of pip , this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner , and by ethan hawke as an adult ) . \\nfinn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie , or should that be mrs . joe , ( kim dickens ) , and her boorish fisherman husband , joe ( chris cooper ) . \\nthe setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s . \\nfinn is a blooming artist , and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) . \\nduring one of these escapades , he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) . \\nborrowing a page from the superhuman max cady , deniro\\'s criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity , and favors hiding on the ocean floor . \\nok . . . maybe \\nthat\\'s an exaggeration , but he certainly beats any of houdini\\'s records in the opening scenes of the film . \\nand that\\'s nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finn\\'s motorboat , but i digress . \\nanyway , finn does the convict a good deed , just to show that he\\'s a really swell guy . \\nand then the plot moves on . \\nenter miss havisham . . . or \\nms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) . \\nabandoned at the altar some 26 years ago , ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid . \\nwith bizarre clothing , eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup , anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role . \\nalthough she ends up nowhere near a believable character , she does add some humor to the film . \\njoe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner , but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece , estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl , gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) . \\nfor no apparent reason , other than to provide the main plot of the film , finn is instantly stricken for the estella . \\nperhaps it\\'s her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person , or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before . \\nin any case , neither as children nor adults , chemistry simply doesn\\'t exist between the two , and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her . \\neven when , as an adult , finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor , reacquaints himself with estella , and draws her portrait in the nude , there\\'s nothing . \\nin fact , there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnear\\'s gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets . \\nat this point , the audience has grown as cold and detached as estella\\'s character , and couldn\\'t care less about the two characters . \\nthe bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow . \\nshe fails to imbue estella , a remote character in the book , with even the vaguest traces of humanity . \\nthere\\'s obviously something wrong when , watching the film , you\\'re more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character . \\nwithout a strong estella , finn\\'s obsession seems baseless . \\nyou wish he would just stop whining , let estella marry his rival , walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria ) , and just get on with his life . \\nin fact , the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot . \\nfinn\\'s relationship with his brother-in-law , joe , is interesting , if a bit stereotypical . \\nwhat\\'s more fascinating are his interactions with deniro . \\nalthough it\\'s only a bit part , it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create . \\nit is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film . \\nsome of the shots work , but others are too obviously staged ( for example , both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact . \\nfinn\\'s art ( actually the creations of italian painter , francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film , but it mostly fails to have the intended effect . \\nwe never see why finn would generate this style of art , which is simultaneously crude and insightful . \\nas a result , it ends up as distant as the rest of the film . \\nmodernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeare\\'s romeo+juliet ) . \\nsimply update the action to a modern setting , and apply plenty of modern rock . \\nbut such adornments do little to perk up great expectations . \\nas much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it , you\\'d probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless

       " b\"depending on your degree of cinematic acumen , last man standing is either a ) a prohibition-era remake of akira kurosawa's 1961 classic yojimbo ; b ) a prohibition-era remake of sergio leone's 1964 classic a fistful of dollars ; c ) a prohibition-era action drama with a completely original story-line . \\nnew line is certainly counting on the fact that there are far more potential viewers in category ( c ) than in the other two combined , much as the recent remakes of diabolique and the vanishing counted on avoiding such comparisons . \\nthe fact is that there is yet another way of looking at last man standing , which is as the first film version of the story which nods to the _real_ source material , the dashiell hammett novel _red harvest_ . \\nit also shows that kurosawa and leone knew better what to do with that material than hammett himself . \\nthis time around , the man with no name is played by bruce willis , a fellow with a shady history of an undefined nature who rolls into the texas border town of jericho one day on his way to mexico . \\nby all appearances , jericho is well on its way to becoming a ghost town , with the few remaining inhabitants generally belonging to one of two bootlegging operations fighting for control of liquor coming over the border . \\none is headed by an irishman named doyle ( david patrick kelly ) ; the other is run by chicago-connected italian mobster strozzi ( ned eisenberg ) . \\ncalling himself john smith , the man decides that there is money to be made from the conflict , and hires himself out as an enforcer to doyle's side . \\nbut smith's allegiance is as uncertain as his name , and he begins to play the two sides against each other while trying to stay one step ahead of both of them . \\nviewers familiar with both previous incarnations of this story will find virtually nothing radically changed from a plotting standpoint , and that alone should make last man standing somewhat more respectable than other recent hollywood remakes-cum-bastardizations . \\nthere is the happily ineffectual lawman ( bruce dern ) , the unhappily detained object of one of the bosses' affections ( karina lombard ) , the barkeep who becomes our anti-hero's only friend ( william sanderson ) , suspicious lieutenants ( christopher walken and michael imperioli ) to question the bosses' trust in smith , a brutal beating , and a big fire . \\ndirector walter hill gives the proceedings his usual injection of steroids , including a pair of guns for willis which have the ability to propel an assailant backward with sufficient thrust to achieve escape velocity , but at least he doesn't try to turn the story into a slasher film or a buddy picture . \\nwhat he _does_ do is nearly as big a mistake , and that is to provide a running voice-over narration by willis which rings of the standard hard-boiled style of pulp detective fiction . \\nyes , that narration is full of cliches , but those are are not particularly troubling . \\nthe problem is that both yojimbo and a fistful of dollars succeeded largely on the inscrutability of their lead characters . \\nthey were a mystery , to the other characters in the film and to the audience , their motives never entirely clear even after they have acted , and that quality contributed to their almost mythical status . \\nwith john smith's voice chattering on in the background and allowing us into his every thought , he becomes more mundane , just another tough guy trying to stay alive . \\nit feels like a hammett novel , all right , and hill can plead faithfulness to his text for his choice , but it simply doesn't work . \\nthe narration allows the man with no name to take us into his confidence , and the man with no name takes _no one_ into his confidence . \\neven if you walk into last man standing as a blank slate , i can't imagine it being much more than a heavily armed minor distraction . \\nwillis tones down his macho swagger as the taciturn smith , but there is still a level on which he always seems like he is counting on being tougher than everyone else rather than smarter than everyone else . \\nchristopher walken plays doyle's brutal henchman as a slight variation on his gallery of soft-spoken psychos , and there isn't another single character whom makes even the slightest impression . \\nwith no compelling antagonist for smith , there is no build-up towards the expected showdown , and when it does come , that showdown is over so quickly you wonder what all the fuss was about . \\ncinematographer lloyd ahern ( who also did the only noteworthy work on hill's 1995 flop wild bill ) creates some nifty sunburned vistas , but his work is only to keep the eye distracted between the spurts of gunfire and the next bit of counter-productive narration . \\nsometimes when someone sees a lackluster remake of a revered original , they'll wonder what all the talk was about . \\nin the case of last man standing , it is those who know the originals who will wonder what all that talking was about . \\n\",\n",

       " b' \" deep rising \" gives you that sinking feeling both literally and figuratively : not only does the movie take place on a cruise ship slowly being immersed into the middle of the ocean by a squid-like menace , but the unfolding story is artificial , silly and almost completely derivative of countless other ( and , for the most part , better ) films . \\nwhile dumb monster movies can at least be decent guilty pleasures -- take , for example , the schlocky mountain highs of last spring\\'s \" anaconda \" -- \" deep rising \" has no tongue to put in its cheek . \\nfolks , we\\'re only a month into the new year , and already here\\'s a candidate for one of its stinkiest releases . \\nmost of the action takes place on the argonautica , a luxury liner in the middle of its maiden voyage ( uh-oh -- if these people had seen \" titanic , \" then maybe they\\'d have known to stay home ) when it\\'s attacked by a giant , tentacled sea creature . \\nthe only survivors are slinky jewel thief trilian ( famke janssen ) , argonautica owner canton ( anthony heald ) and a few other crew members . \\na mercenary team , lead by resourceful captain john finnegan ( treat williams ) , board the argonautica looking for assistance after their own boat breaks down nearby . \\nbut what their search of the ship uncovers is something blood-soaked , hungry and not very helpful . \\nthe main problem with \" deep rising \" is its overt familiarity ; the movie makes absolutely no attempt to differentiate itself from most sci-fi/horror films in recent memory . \\nthe concept is \" leviathan \" meets \" titanic , \" with a dash of \" speed 2 \" thrown in for good ( or is that bad ? ) \\nmeasure . \\nthis monster is equal parts \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" and \" the relic , \" knows how to open doors like the raptors from \" jurassic park \" and even gets to expel a half-digested victim ( a neat effect , admittedly ) a la the giant snake in \" anaconda . \" \\nsome of the attack sequences are straight out of \" jaws \" and \" alien . \" \\na scene where the remaining survivors have to travel under water to escape death is right out of \" alien resurrection . \" \\nthere\\'s even a jet ski chase like \" hard rain . \" \\nand the list goes on . \\nwatching \" deep rising \" \\'s cast battle the beast is a murky chore in itself , because none of them have well-developed characters , nor do they seem to project even the slightest sense of fear when facing their enemy . \\nwilliams is affable enough , but his finnegan just isn\\'t believable . \\nan interesting supporting cast is thoroughly wasted ; pretty famke janssen , best known as \" goldeneye \" \\'s killer thighs , is trapped in a forced romantic interest with williams , while kevin j . o\\'connor , as finnegan\\'s mechanic , provides comic relief with screechy manic shtick that gets old fast . \\ndjimon honsou , who received raves for his performance as a noble slave in december\\'s \" amistad , \" pops up in a brief part . \\nhe needs to stay away from the water . \\nthe movie\\'s final shot is a groaner , as is the 11th-hour regurgitation of a subplot involving an on-ship saboteur . \\nas if a cast deserving of their snack food-fate isn\\'t bad enough ( when you taunt the monster , you\\'re really asking for it ) , \" deep rising \" is a slow , stupid slog through a story without a single bright spot . \\nand since we all know that the higher the casualty rate is , the closer we are to the end of the movie , rooting for this overgrown squid to swallow the whole ship isn\\'t out of the question . \\n',\n",

       " b'there are times when the success of a particular film depends entirely on one actor\\'s effort . \\noften a single performance can turn what might have been a rather mediocre movie into something worthwhile . \\nwhen one of these comes along , i usually try to think about how many other people put work into the movie , that there is no way one person could possible carry the entire project on his shoulders . \\nbut sometimes there is simply no other explanation , and such is the case with \" the hurricane . \" \\nthis biopic about falsely convicted boxer rubin \" hurricane \" carter would normally be called \" norman jewison\\'s \\'the hurricane , \\' \" as per the tradition of referring to a film \" belonging \" to a director . \\nbut though he does decent work , jewison cannot claim ownership of \" the hurricane , \" because there is one reason this film works at all , and his name is denzel washington . \\nwashington plays carter , a boxer who in 1967 was convicted of a late-night shooting in a bar . \\njailed for 20 years , he maintained that he had never committed the crimes , but remained in jail after a second trial and countless appeals . \\nthe situation changed when a group of canadians moved to washington and worked on freeing carter . \\nthrough the efforts of that group and carter\\'s lawyers , he was eventually freed when their case was heard in federal court and the judge ruled that rubin carter had been unfairly convicted . \\nthe film details carter\\'s childhood , which had him in and out of jail because of the efforts of a racist cop ( dan hedaya ) . \\nwhen he finally got out of prison for good , carter became a rising star as a middleweight pro boxer , seemingly having his career on track , until the police framed him for multiple homicide . \\ndespite the efforts of political activists and celebrities , he remained imprisoned . \\nflash forward to 1983 , when lesra ( vicellous reon shannon ) a young african-american boy , living with a group of canadian tutors , reads the book carter wrote while in prison . \\nthe book , entitled \" the sixteenth round , \" opens young lesra\\'s eyes to the injustice that was carter\\'s life , and he vows to help free the incarcerated boxer . \\nlesra convinces his canadian friends ( deborah unger , liev schreiber , john hannah ) to work with him towards his goal . \\n \" the hurricane \" leans on denzel washington . \\nhe must carry virtually every scene by sheer force of will , and he does so brilliantly . \\nit\\'s probably accurate to say that washington does not embody rubin carter , because he plays a character far stronger and nobler than any real person could hope to be . \\nit would perhaps be more accurate to say that washington embodies the character of rubin carter--a fictional personality invented solely for the film . \\nthe actor\\'s work is masterful ; washington throws himself into every moment , refusing to keep the audience at arm\\'s length . \\nwe feel everything he feels : the humiliation of having to return to prison after fighting so hard to make something of his life , the pain of having to order his wife to give up the fight , and the utter despair he feels when coming to the conclusion that all hope is lost . \\nwashington\\'s is a performance of weight and emotional depth . \\nhe doesn\\'t merely play angry , happy , or sad ; he feels it at the deepest level . \\nhis work is masterful , and for half of this film i realized that the scene i was watching would not have been nearly as affecting as it was if it had been in the hands of another actor . \\nnorman jewison directs the film , doing a reasonably good job of pacing and shot selection . \\n \" the hurricane \" moves quickly , with no scene drawn out much further than necessary and the narrative galloping along nicely . \\njewison handles his multiple flashbacks well ; the audience is always aware of just what the time and place of each scene is , and nothing is terribly confusing . \\nhis boxing scenes , constructed with clear inspiration from \" raging bull , \" get inside the action very well , and they are believable as real sports footage . \\njewison puts together a particularly nice scene by utilizing a pretty cool trick : carter is sent to solitary confinement for 90 days when he refuses to wear a prison uniform , and jewison , assisted by some wonderful acting from a game washington , shows how carter gradually starts to lose his mind during the constant solitude , and eventually we get three rubin carters arguing with each other in one cell . \\njewison\\'s best achievement in \" the hurricane \" is succeeding at showing how carter becomes an embittered man during his hard-knock life , and how he is able to break out of that bitterness and learn to trust people again . \\nsadly , though , the film\\'s chief failures lie with the screenplay , as with most of the good-but-not-great efforts to round the pike this winter . \\nthere is much to interest a viewer in \" the hurricane , \" but it seems that every time the film gets a chance to take the most clich ? d route possible , it does . \\ntake a look at the supporting characters , for example , who are drawn up as either entirely good or entirely evil . \\ncarter and lesra ( played nicely by shannon , who deserves credit ) are the only real people here ;

       " b'seen february 15 , 1998 on home video ( borrowed from chris wessell ) . \\nwhen it comes to modern gangster movies , it\\'s really difficult to describe and review them without making comparisons to other films of the genre and/or just using the word \" routine . \" \\ni\\'ve always subscribed to the philosophy that any idea ( no matter how many times it\\'s been used before ) can provide for a good story and \" donnie brasco \" clinches this idea . \\nit\\'s not unlike most of the great films of the genre , yet it never apes another\\'s style as it has a good layer of authenticity , even if its core is a tad stale . \\nthe film starts off in typical fashion by defining its atmosphere of new york city in the late 1970s and the mobsters who inhibit it . \\nwe meet lefty ( pacino ) , an aging wiseguy who can still walk the walk and talk the talk . \\nhe and his associates go through the generic motions you expect to see in crime films like this . \\nsomehow he comes across donnie brasco ( depp ) , a younger guy with a lot of spunk who isn\\'t afraid of lefty and his rep , and even manages to befriend him after lefty was ready to kill him . \\nit\\'s clear donnie is new to the life and lefty recognizes this immediately , telling him all the tricks of the trade . \\ni have never seen this technique of actually revealing the mafioso idiosyncrasies done before and for this the film deserves credit . \\nhowever , we soon realize donnie is actually joe pistone , an fbi agent working undercover - a character who symbolizes the viewer as he will soon be purged into the lifestyle and treated as a newcomer . \\nthe first act works as a guided to ot of rhetoric about wiseguy honor , a brief history of the mob , definitions of their slang , and where their money comes from and who it goes to . \\nthe screenplay is rather sketchy on the details surrounding these elements , however , the fact they are mentioned at all is quite original . \\nmost gangster movies seem to be made with the notion the viewer already knows how the mob works ( probably from watching other gangster movies ) , and although this attitude comes across , the film tries to fill in all the holes where and when it can and the effort is appreciable . \\nthankfully the film doesn\\'t become too caught up in the tedious details of organized crime , and instead opts for character development . \\nmuch of the story is told simply through the interaction between lefty and donnie . \\npacino is outstanding here as the pathetic hood who speaks of his job in the same manner any blue collar worker would . \\nhe\\'s old and exhausted but seems to enjoy what he does , just as anyone loyal to the same employer for over 30 years might be . \\nwe learn of his accomplishments , which are quite impressive within their context , and when he complains about not being made top boss , it\\'s easy to sympathize with him . \\nnewell constantly plays up this aspect , making it a major theme which works well in the long run . \\nas donnie is constantly impressing and even one-upping lefty , it\\'s hard to tell which emotion is more powerful : the fact donnie is getting closer to nailing the mob ; or the fact lefty has once again been over shadowed . \\nmost of the film tells the story of donnie\\'s life in mafia , which creates for many sub-plots and individual conflicts , but doesn\\'t always seem to come together as a whole . \\nthe storytelling is genuinely interesting throughout , even when the motions the characters go through seem familiar . \\nthe resonance to donnie\\'s actual assignment varies , he often reports back to the feds with detail of his progress , but it doesn\\'t always seem to have much meaning . \\nback home , his wife maggie ( heche ) is ready to divorce him because he\\'s never a and the family is suffering . \\nsince this is based on a true story i wouldn\\'t doubt this would happen , although the way it is handled often borders on the melodramatic . \\nmy only major complaint is the film seems to have no final act , or at least any real sense of closure . \\na climax of sorts does occur , but there\\'s little feeling of a payoff . \\nwe get a happy ending , which is good , but perhaps a sad ending would have been more powerful . \\naside from a few minor , general flaws , \" donnie brasco \" manages to be a solid piece of storytelling and character development . \\nit may be routine , but it\\'s good , and that\\'s respectful . \\n',\n",
       " b'of circumcision , psychic wounds and the family sitcom \\nthe opening segment is something of a foretaste of this film . \\nthere\\'s a guy\\'s voice telling us how he tries to imagine what his biological parents look like , and on the screen we see images of a variety of oldish men and women . \\nas his imagination plays o n , he ( and we ) picture these motley characters in a mix-and-match shuffle of unlikely marriages , businesswomen with bums , matrons with paint salesmen , the images coming on in a faster and faster frenzy . \\nit\\'s not just a witty , funny summing up of the film \\'s themes - you might not guess it yet , but it sets the pattern for the way the story goes on . \\nwhat starts out as a step in a fairly sensible direction , gets taken on a road trip , put through a detour or two and finds itself freewheeling towards an immin ent crash . \\nthat may not sound so different from the average family sitcom , and the general idea of the film doesn\\'t , at first , seem so wildly distant from standard-issue hollywood comedy : man who was adopted as a child ( ben still er ) sets out on a journey to meet his real parents , along with his wife ( patricia arquette ) , his baby , and a pretty psychology-researcher ( tea leoni ) in tow . \\nvarious mix-ups , shenanigans , oddball characters and , yup , disasters follow . \\nbut if you think you\\'ve been here before , the dialogue and the direction ( by david o . russell , who made spanking the monkey ) take it into another dimension . \\nthe dreaded t-name seems an inevitable reference point ( what with a drug overdose scene and the casting of arquette from true romance ) but really the point is that the foot-massage master hasn\\'t got a monopoly on plot twists and fast , funny , irreverent lines , or on the absurdities of ordinary speech . \\nwhether it\\'s about circumcision , psychic wounds , oral sex , carjacking , the beauties of the armpit area , or ronald reagan , the script never seems to run out of hilarious invention . \\nthe best thing is how these words aren\\'t just there for the punchlines , but are great precisely because they\\'re said in character , like tea leoni\\'s neurotically-charged psychobabbler who\\'s able to say under assault , \" it\\'s understandable if you find this threatening \" . \\nthe cast is excellent throughout , and , rather than singling out anybody , kudos are due to the fine ensemble acting , with the sometimes frenetically overlapping dialogue and the sense of a dozen different reagents colliding to the point of fission . \\nthere are some elements of a woody allen film in this ( not to mention the hand-held camera and loose , improvisational feel of some scenes ) . \\nlike allen , russell\\'s interests are in the volatile sexual politics of couples and the neurotic obsessions in both pare nts and children ( and everybody , really ) . \\nstill , if you\\'re expecting a privileged moment of revelation and emotional outpouring a la \" murphy brown \" / \" frasier \" / fill-in-the-blank-american-comedy , well , it won\\'t happen . \\nthe film sets up expectations like these , with the lead character\\'s search f or his origins and his hopes of self-healing , only to knock them down . \\nif the conventional sitcom structure is to put a slightly loopy family in catastrophic conditions only to rediscover their essential lovey one-ness , flirting with disaster\\'s charact ers embark on a journey to seek that essential state but find themselves only plunging into more weirdness and dysfunctional chaos the further they go . \\nand that , the film suggests , is the essential family state - and you better learn to love it . \\nsomehow , this is perversely feelgood cinema , right up to its manic end . \\n',\n",
       " b\"movies based on video games , such as street fighter or mario bros . , have never generated much interest at the box office . \\nbut when the first mortal kombat movie came out in 1995 , it did surprisingly well . \\nwith a simple story , a pulsating soundtrack , and lots of awesomely choreographed fight scenes , the movie moved quickly and displayed lots of energy . \\nit got my vote for 'the movie where i expected the least and got the most' . \\nand , if you haven't had the opportunity , i would definitely recommend that you see it on video . \\nin the world of mortal kombat , based on the popular arcade game , dark forces from outworld try to infiltrate earth's realm with the ulimate goal of total conquest and the destruction of humanity . \\nthe mortal kombat refers to a competition , fought by human mortals against outworld's minions , which if won , will guarantee earth's safety for another generation . \\nmk2 picks up almost immediately after the humans return victoriously from competition . \\ndespite their victory , however , a gateway has somehow opened , and outworld continues in its quest to conquer earth . \\noutworld's warriors include an impressive collection of fighters , including shao kahn , mintoro ( a centaur ) , sheeva ( a four-armed ogre ) , and sindel . \\nearth's mortal warriors , under the leadership of the benevolent god , lord rayden , includes liu kang , princess kitana , sonya blade and jax , who must fight against outworld's forces . \\nit's an easy enough premise , but unfortunately ( very unfortunately ) , the writers try to do too much with the movie . \\nit is only a video game , after all , but the on-screen version tries to go beyond it's comic book boundaries by adding depth , a conceptualization of self-worth , and worst of all , a love story . \\nthis becomes very awkward , because all of the players are fighters and nothing more . \\nthey are likable and impressive when they are showcasing their martial arts and fighting skills , but look extremely awkward and uncomfortable when they are required to actually act . \\nthis becomes embarrassingly apparent , for example , as the movie tries to develop a romantic bond between liu kang and princess kitana . \\nthe original mk was smart in letting the players do what they do best . \\nthey spoke little , but fought a lot . \\nthus , the movie was easy to digest . \\nhowever , mk2 tries to give these players a certain amount of depth , an element that was lacking in the first movie , but the attempt here fails miserably . \\nthis uneasy feeling is readily apparent , for example , whenever you hear lord rayden speak . \\nnot only does he talk in riddles and offer enigmatic ( e . g . \\nuseless ) advice , but he speaks so slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom . \\ntry reading this half as fast , and you'll hear what i mean . \\nbut the movie is not a complete fatality . \\nfight scenes are well-choreographed , highlighted by terrific acrobatics and agility . \\nand players of the game will be rewarded with the inclusion of practically every character from the video game , although their screen time amounts to nothing more than a cameo . \\neven if you're not familiar with the video game , each fighter has their own costume and unique weaponry to easily differentiate themselves . \\nbut it's just too little of what movie-goers and especially fans of the game will expect . \\noddly , the inclusion of the human element actually pollutes the purity of the mortal kombat essence . \\nand the poor acting results in a muddled movie that offers the viewing audience little chance for survival . \\n ( i am now talking very slowly as if to simulate infinite wisdom ) . \\nrent the first one , but the sequel is for kombat fans only . \\n\",\n",

\\nin a way , star wars is so much a part of our cultural heritage that it feels silly and almost artificial to try to summarize it . \\nit's a story about a young man's coming of age , a fight for freedom against an oppressive empire , a tale of swashbuckling and derring-do the likes of which haven't been seen on the silver screen in decades , strange new worlds with strange alien creatures and weird surprises around every turn , and the yearning within each of us to realize our dreams and make a difference in the world . \\nit's high adventure , incredible special effects , and . . . well , it's just an _experience_ . \\nsomething about this movie sparked the imagination of a generation . . . and \\nit's about to do so again . \\nthis new release of star wars comes as no surprise to many of the film's devoted fans , who have been trading rumors and bits of information about it for quite some time now . \\ninterviews , trailers , leaks from within lucasfilm . . . all of these have been collected , collated , and placed on webpages for people to see ( pages such as http : //www . islandnet . com/~corona/films/details/sw4 . html \\nor , my personal favorite , http : //leopard . cs . latrobe . edu . au/~koukoula/ \\n ) . \\npictures of before and after have been placed side by side . . . even \\nmonths before the movies were released , fans were making comparisons . \\nin some cases , the changes were nothing less than phenomenal , and this can be seen from the comparison shots even before you go into the movie theater . \\nthe digital matte effects that were little more than a toy in forrest gump are put to excellent use here , unnoticeably sprucing up scenes that that george lucas was unsatisfied with in the original . \\nfor instance , in my personal favorite example , the ancient temple on yavin that was formerly a flat stone edifice now has deep , moss-covered carvings and etchings . \\nand mos eisley spaceport is now a bustling , booming city , with more surprises and things going on in the background than you can notice on the first viewing . \\nall the starships and fighters are now computer-animated , getting rid of glitches and artifacts of the special effects processes used when the film was originally made--and they look _fantastic_ . \\nfour and a half minutes of new or missing footage have been added , including a scene with jabba the hutt that had originally been shelved because the state of special effects in 1977 simply couldn't do it justice . \\nhowever , much of the ten million dollars that was spent on the star wars special edition restoration went into restoring the quality of the film itself . \\nthe negatives , badly damaged by the ravages of time , were brightened and returned to their original splendor . \\nthe audio tracks were remixed and reprocessed , with reworked sound effects by effects maven ben burtt , into glorious , booming , theater-shaking full-thx dolby digital stereo . \\nand _that_ , more than the added scenes or new special effects , is where the real value of this new version lies . \\nit's really true what they say in the commercials : star wars loses _so much_ on the small screen . \\neven letterboxing doesn't make up for the decrease in size and definition . \\nin regard to the star wars special edition , and to the other two films of the trilogy which have yet to be released , i'll make this final recommendation : go and see it . \\ngo and see it more than once . . . it \\nmay be another twenty years before it comes back to the big screen after it's gone this time . \\ntake along the youngsters who've never had the big-screen star wars experience--you'll enjoy seeing it through their eyes as much as they will enjoy it for the first time . \\nthere's magic in this movie--special edition or no , there can be no denying that it's still star wars , and still has the power to thrill and enthrall children of all ages , from four to four hundred . \\nlet's all return to that time long ago , and that galaxy far , far away . . . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan's latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \\nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \\nonce again , chan's screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star's character simply jackie , with no last name . \\nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \\nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter's ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \\nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \\nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy's existence are chan's comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \\ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan's , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \\nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \\nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop's thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx's daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \\nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film's end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan's athletic prowess ) . \\nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan's latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980's the big brawl and 1985's the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \\nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \\n\",\n",
       " b'in the wake of the smashing success of \" rumble in the bronx , \" it\\'s looking more and more likely that more jackie chan films will see american release . \\nrumor has it that one of these films will be drunken master ii . \\nthe version i have is a copy from the laserdisc ; it\\'s widescreen and bilingually-subtitled , as are most hong kong films these days . \\navailability over here in the united states is very limited ; these films must either be purchased via pirates or sought out from asian distributors such as tai seng . \\nthe subtitling on the copy i have is slightly hard to read ; the letters are white and a bit small . \\nalthough the american release will almost certainly be dubbed , this review is of the subtitled version , so please keep that in mind if you\\'re reading this review to help you decide whether to go out and see it . \\nto be fair , i must admit that i\\'ve never been very fond of \" period-piece \" martial arts movies--the ones set in some nebulous china of the distant or not so distant past . \\nperhaps it\\'s because most of those i\\'ve seen were filmed on inferior stock , with either butchered dubbing or all-but-illegible subtitling , or perhaps it\\'s because their plots all tend to be very similar to each other and , in many cases , all but nonexistant . \\nin fact , many of them get so wrapped up in their subplots that they seem to forget their main plot entirely until only a few minutes before the end . \\nor , for that matter , it might be because the jackie chan films with more modern settings ( armour of god , rumble in the bronx , etc . ) tend to have more spectacular stunts , often involving large motor vehicles and large explosions , whereas period pieces simply have the martial arts . \\nhaving said that , i must now turn right around and say that drunken master ii is a remarkable exception to all or most of the above , is one of the better martial arts films i\\'ve seen , and i quite enjoyed it . \\nsurprised ? \\nwell , so was i . \\ndrunken master ii is about a young man named wong fei-hong ( played by jackie chan ) who is a master of the drunken boxing style of kung fu . \\nwhere he learned this style is uncertain , as his father , wong kei-ying ( ti lung ) is steadfast in his opposition to fei-hong\\'s practicing it rather than some more normal style of kung fu . \\napparently , fei-hong is some sort of figure from chinese folklore , rather like paul bunyan is for americans , but i\\'ve heard very little about this , and could quite well be wrong , so i\\'ll leave analysis of that to the people who know it better . \\none of my friends points out that the character of wong fei-hong is also featured in the \" once upon a time in china \" movies , but i have not yet seen those . \\nthe plot of drunken master ii is somewhat hazy , as are the plots to many such films , but if you\\'re watching a jackie chan film , odds are you aren\\'t expecting something on the order of \" war and peace \" . \\nthe story seems to revolve around those evil foreigners who are spiriting away ancient chinese relics ( and hence , china\\'s cultural heritage ) while overworking , underpaying , and beating up chinese workers in a nearby steel mill . \\nhowever , this plot merely serves as a framework for the other main story of the film--fei-hong\\'s perpetual struggle to win his girlfriend , supplicate his father , keep his ( pregnant ) mother ( played by anita mui ) from fighting , and keep from getting beaten up by evil foreigner thugs . \\nthe macguffin that drives the plot ( s ) is a precious antique jade imperial seal which is being taken away by the evil foreigners . \\nin the beginning , fei-hong accidentally steals it while trying to recover an identically-wrapped box containing the medicinal ginseng his father was bringing back for a customer . \\nin the process , he clashes with another thief , who is himself trying for the seal but ends up instead with the ginseng . \\nafter fei-hong narrowly avoids getting caught with the seal by the evil foreigners\\' lackies , thanks to some timely intervention by a general\\'s son ( a cameo appearance by andy lau , who would later take on the starring role in drunken master iii ! ) , comedic chaos ensues back at the wong household when fei-hong and his mother attempt to come up with a replacement for the missing ginseng . \\nand so it goes . \\nand the plot thickens later on , such as when fei-hong\\'s girlfriend maneuvers him into a kung fu match with a rival , or when fei-hong and the thief , now revealed to be a loyalist manchu officer trying to recover the seal and stop the evil foreigners , are attacked en masse ( another grand kung-fu movie tradition ) , but i think i\\'ve already spent more time on the plot than it really deserves . \\nlet\\'s move on to the real draw of jackie chan movies . . . the \\naction . \\nthere\\'s plenty of martial arts action to be found in this movie . . . of \\ncourse , in a kung fu film , that\\'s to be expected . \\nhowever , this isn\\'t just another kung fu movie ; this one has jackie chan doing the fight and stunt choreography , and jackie chan is a genius . \\nthe primary martial arts \" style \" featured in the film is drunken boxing , a form of kung fu which attempts to draw the adversary off his guard by making it seem like the fellow using it is drunk . \\nfurther , for the purposes of this film at least , drunken boxers fight better when they actually _are_ intoxicated . . . but \\nthere\\'s a fine line between just drunk enough and drunk into a stupor . \\nunder normal circumstances , the idea of someone staggering around looking sloshed but managing to fight effectively and even incredibly might seem rather stupid , but jackie pulls it off with flair . \\nthe kung fu sequences are so intricate in their staging and execution that it is pointless to try to describe it on paper , so i\\'ll just say that the fights--especially the big climactic fight at the end--in themselves make the movie worth watching . \\nanother thing drunken master ii has going for it is the stunt work . \\neven without motor vehicles ( well , not counting a train ) , there are some remarkable stunts in this film . \\namong other things , jackie dives off a balcony into a table and crawls across hot coals ( not once , but at _least_ twice , if you count the outtake shown during the credits ) . \\n ( quicktime movies of these stunts can be found through the www movie database . ) \\nunlike in american films , these stunts are _not_ faked . \\ndrunken master ii stars several veteran actors of the hong kong movie scene , including jackie , ti lung ( \" a better tomorrow \" 1 & 2 ) , and anita mui ( the \" heroic trio \" series , \" rumble in the bronx \" ) . \\nthe performances are first-rate , especially when it comes to the comedy parts of the film . \\nthe scene where fei-hong and his mother conspire literally behind fei-hong\\'s father\\'s back to cover up for the missing ginseng root is hilarious , as is the scene where fei-hong\\'s mother , having just revealed that she is pregnant , is threatening to hurt herself ( in order to draw her husband\\'s anger away from fei-hong ) . \\njackie has developed his knack for physical comedy into a sort of mastery over the years , and he\\'s in fine form all through drunken master ii . \\nas far as cinematography is concerned , it certainly works for this film . \\nit\\'s nothing spectacular , but is at least a dozen times better than all those old kung fu movies of the 70s . \\nthe picture is crisp and clear . \\none thing i find particularly worthy of mention is that , at least in the copy i have , the screen was wider than any film i\\'ve ever seen on videotape before--almost a whole 1/3 of the screen was blocked out above and below . \\n ( watch this on a bigscreen tv or movie theater if you can . ) \\nit will be an utter shame if this film is eventually pan-and-scanned for american video release . \\ndrunken master ii shows the full potential of \" period piece \" kung fu movies , and it\\'s good enough to overcome even my usual distaste for such movies . \\nthe plot does meander a bit , but that\\'s to be expected in this type of film . \\nif you like this kind of movie , you\\'ll love this movie , and if not , well , give it a chance anyway . \\nif nothing else , the martial arts and stunt sequences are by themselves worth the price of admission or rental . \\n',\n",
       " b'from a major league baseball radio broadcast , featuring play-by- play man harry canary and color man whitey hashbrown , with special guest commentator james berardinelli . \\nhc : as we go to the top of the 8th , we\\'re joined in the booth by film critic james berardinelli , who\\'s here fresh from seeing the new baseball movie , major league : back to the minors , the third in the popular saga taking a lighter look at the majors . \\nnice to see you , jim . \\nas a big baseball fan and a movie reviewer , can you give us the scoop on the new flick ? \\njb : my opinion : the producers should have stopped while they were ahead , and that was nine years ago . \\none entry was definitely enough , and i\\'m surprised there was a third after the anemic showing and low quality of major league 2 . this latest installment has all the earmarks of something that should have been released direct-to-video . \\nit\\'s worse than a mediocre made-for-tv feature . \\ni should also mention that this movie likely won\\'t play all that well in cleveland . \\nnow that the real indians are perennial contenders , they have been replaced by the minnesota twins as the cinematic sadsacks . \\nactually , most of the action involves the twins\\' aaa minor league club , the buzz , rather than the actual major league franchise . \\nhc : sorry to interrupt , jim , but we still have to do play-by-play for the game on the field . \\nleading off this inning is john warren . \\nhe steps into the batter\\'s box and takes kent\\'s pitch low for ball one . \\nwh : so , the story\\'s strictly minor league , right ? \\nwhat\\'s it about ? \\njb : scott bakula , the guy from quantum leap , plays career minor league pitcher gus cantrell . \\nwhen twins owner roger dorn , once again portrayed by corbin bernsen , needs a new manager for his aaa team , he offers the job to gus , who is now faced with two daunting tasks : turn the team around and groom hot prospect downtown anderson ( played by walt goggins ) for a promotion to \" the show . \" \\nwith the help of former major leaguers pedro cerrano ( dennis haysbert ) , rube baker ( eric bruskotter ) , and isuro tanaka ( takaaki ishibashi ) , gus gets the buzz on the right track . \\nin fact , he is so successful that he earns the enmity of the jealous manager of the big-league club , leonard huff ( played with over-the-top relish by ted mcginley ) . \\nsoon , dorn has arranged an exhibition game that pits gus\\' overachieving group against huff\\'s overpaid , last-place bunch . \\nwh : can we guess who wins ? \\njb : the results have all the suspense of watching the videotape of a game when you\\'ve already seen the box score . \\non top of that , none of the mock-ups are presented with much flair . \\nthey\\'re not just boring ; they\\'re lackluster . \\nbut the major league movies have never been about drama or tension ; they\\'ve been about using baseball situations to generate laughs . \\nhc : warren fouls off a fastball . \\n1 and 1 . \\nwh : are there lots of yuks in this one ? \\njb : not one , from start to finish . \\ni enjoyed the first major league because it was reasonably fresh and funny . \\nokay , a lot of the jokes were sophomoric , but they made me laugh . \\nthe two sequels haven\\'t just been stale , but their humor quotient has been abysmally low . \\neven bob uecker\\'s once-sharp one-liners have turned lame , and they\\'re the closest the film comes to being even vaguely amusing . \\nhc : here\\'s the 1-1 pitch . \\nlooooooong drive ? fair or foul ? foul ball ! \\nthe count goes to 1 and 2 . \\nwh : does the film at least get the baseball details correct ? \\njb : yes . \\nthere aren\\'t any glaring errors like there were in one of the best-ever baseball movies , the natural . \\nbut i\\'d gladly trade a technically accurate film for one with a good story , believable characters , or even a little genuine humor . \\nheck , the naked gun is a better baseball comedy than major league : back to the minors . \\nwh : it\\'s nice to see old friends one more time , isn\\'t it ? \\nlike cerrano , tanaka , and dorn . \\njb : depends on whether you really care that anyone is back . \\nthere aren\\'t any real characters here ? just an assortment of cliched oddballs . \\nyeah , the voodoo hitter , the catcher who can\\'t throw back to the pitcher , the japanese player , and the conceited player-turned-owner have all returned , but who really cares ? \\nthey have no depth . \\nnotable absences include tom berenger\\'s veteran and charlie sheen\\'s \" wild thing . \" \\nwe don\\'t really miss them , though . \\nhc : breaking ball , low and outside . \\n2 and 2 . \\nwh : so you\\'re saying that we should give this one a miss ? \\njb : that\\'s right . \\nto use baseball terminology , it\\'s a three-pitch strikeout . \\nif you\\'re looking for a good movie that involves baseball , try popping the natural , field of dreams , bull durham , or even the first major league into the vcr . \\nactually , this is an oddly-timed release , since baseball fans are likely to be spending more time in parks than in theaters . \\neven the minor league seasons are already underway . \\ndon\\'t bother with major league : back to the minors . \\nit\\'s a wretched time- waster . \\nwh : thanks for the advice . \\njb : you\\'re welcome . \\nhc : and here\\'s the 2-2 pitch . \\nfouled back , right into this booth . \\nhey , jim , heads up ! \\noops . \\nsomebody better get him some ice for that . \\nhe may be good at deflecting bad baseball movies , but he needs to learn not to duck into foul balls . \\nodd how warren seemed to aim that ball right at him , almost as if he has a grudge to settle . \\nanyway , back to the action on the field ?

       " b'for a movie with such deep religious and spiritual undertones , it is surprising to find the messenger : the story of joan of arc such an ungodly mess . \\nin the early to mid 1400\\'s , there was little in the way of spiritual light to be found shining from the heart of a man or woman . \\nthe church was a dismally dark and oppressive place . \\nfrance was involved in \" the hundred years war \" against england . \\nthere was no strong political leadership in the country . \\nmorale was low , there being little hope for the future . \\nit was within this setting that a young french girl began hearing \" voices \" and seeing \" visions . \" \\nconvinced that these were messages from god , she brazenly demanded to see the dauphin in order to deliver the message directly to him . \\nthe message : if he would give her an army to command , she would deliver to him the crown . \\nhe does . . . \\nand she does . \\nthen , once seated on the throne , he abandons her to her english captors . \\ndirector luc besson ( the fifth element ) may have co-wrote the script but he never appeared to have a proper handle on the material . \\nthe inconsistencies of the cast , the confusing blur of the violent battle scenes , the inappropriate musical score , and the lack of a vibrant life force at the center of the film adds up to a largely disappointing end product which is oftentimes unintentionally laughable . \\nhis biggest miscue was to cast his wife , milla jovovich ( the fifth element ) in the title role . \\nms . jovovich , looks spectacular as joan , clad in battle armor , astride a similarly protected horse . \\nif looks were enough to fully convey a character , she would have been brilliant . \\nsince it isn\\'t , she tried ( and failed ) to act the part . \\nher joan is unbalanced , \" inspiring \" the troops merely by screaming stridently and waving her banner or sword over her head like a woman possessed . \\njohn malkovich ( being john malkovich ) fares a bit better as the dauphin , who joan would see on the throne as charles vii . \\nan easily manipulated man , his weakness of character foreshadows the betrayal of joan which would lead to her death . \\nfaye dunaway ( the thomas crown affair ) gives a strong performance in minimal screen time as the dauphin\\'s mother-in-law and chief advisor . \\nthe army under joan\\'s command are comprised of comical figures , more stooges than soldiers . \\nthe one exception would be tcheky karyo ( la femme nikita ) as dunois , the man who was leading the attack prior to joan\\'s arrival . \\ntrying to plan a systematic campaign , he sees his leadership authority negated by joan\\'s insistence on following her \" visions . \" \\ndustin hoffman ( sphere ) has a small inhuman role as joan\\'s conscience which begins speaking to her while awaiting trial . \\ndressed like cloaked monk , he leads her to doubt herself and her \" revelations . \" \\nas well she should . \\nscriptures do speak of revelation . \\ngod , via his gift of holy spirit , is able to communicate to men . \\nthree of the nine manifestations of holy spirit listed in 1 corinthians 12 deal with receiving revelation . \\nthey are : word of knowledge , word of wisdom , and discerning of spirits . \\neven the scriptures themselves are a result of god giving revelation to his \" holy men . . . \\nwho spake as they were moved by holy spirit ( i . e . \\nby revelation . ) \" \\nbut the scriptures also caution us : \\n \" beloved , believe not every spirit , but try the spirits whether they are of god : because many false prophets are gone out into the world . \" \\n1 john 4 : 1 [kjv] \\njoan\\'s end , ( being burned at the stake at the age of 19 ) , the frenzy ( mob rule ) and blood lust her inspiration wrought , and the death , pain , or suffering which followed her campaign all point to a devilish influence rather than a godly one . \\nwhile her conviction and intense believing remains an admirable quality , she was , as others have been before and since , misled by the spiritual master of deception . \\nas a messenger , she was quite effective . \\nshe was just confused as to whose message she was carrying . \\n',\n",

       " b'while watching loser , it occurred to me that amy heckerling\\'s true genius as a film-maker is casting . \\nin fast times at ridgemont high , she gave us sean penn\\'s jeff spicoli ; in look who\\'s talking , she turned bruce willis into a wise-cracking baby and provided john travolta with is first career revival ; in clueless , she found a star vehicle for the adorableness that is ( or was ) alicia silverstone . \\nshe seems to understand instinctively how to find performers the audience will like in spite of their flaws . \\nunfortunately , she may also be starting to understand that she understands . \\ngiving appealing actors an appealing script creates likeable movies . \\ngiving appealing actors a script in which their appeal _is_ the movie makes for unexpectedly awful films like loser . \\nnaturally , heckerling makes her protagonist an all-around swell guy . \\npaul tannek ( jason biggs ) is a small-town boy who gets a scholarship to nyu , then instantly finds himself an island of compassion and diligence in the cold-hearted big city . \\npaul is the kind of guy who gives up his seat on the subway to an elderly woman ; his roommates adam ( zak orth ) , chris ( tom sadoski ) and noah ( jimmi simpson ) are the kind of guys who blast their music and let their waterbeds leak all over paul . \\npaul is also the kind of guy who adores girls from afar , in this case the lovely dora diamond ( mena suvari ) . \\ndora has problems of her own , including a shortage of funds to pay her tuition and a relationship with a professor , edward alcott ( greg kinnear ) , that\\'s more than slightly one-sided . \\nthey\\'re two conscientious kids who love animals and homeless people , so clearly they belong together , even if paul is a loser . \\ni must confess that , for a while , i was suckered in by heckerling\\'s casting . \\njason biggs is an engaging performer whose unconventional looks make him even easier to embrace ; suvari is a coquette with an undercurrent of intelligence . \\nthey\\'re pleasant enough to watch , and heckerling gives us plenty of scenes establishing how nice they are and how nice their respective antagonists aren\\'t . \\nthen it gradually becomes clear that there\\'s virtually nothing to loser but scenes of that sort . \\nin theory , loser is a romantic comedy , but there is scarcely a laugh to be found in the entire film ( notable exception : a cameo by a scene-stealing comic actor as a video store clerk ) . \\ninstead of taking any time to make the characters\\' situations funny , heckerling spends 98 minutes making her characters\\' situations pathetic . \\nshe shows none of the ear for quirky dialogue that sparked clueless , nor any of that film\\'s interest in lively plotting ( not surprisingly , since clueless\\'s plot came via jane austen\\'s emma ) . \\nshe simply turns the film into a pity party . \\nsince loser is a film composed almost entirely of establishing character , you might think that those characters would be interesting , or at least slightly complicated . \\ninstead , you have people either so perfect or so unredeemable that there\\'s no reason to watch them . \\npaul isn\\'t just a nice guy , he\\'s flawless ; consequently , he\\'s a central character who does absolutely no growing . \\nhis roommates aren\\'t just inconsiderate , they\\'re actively evil-blackmailing professor alcott , drugging women with rohypnol and generally giving humanity a bad name . \\nand professor alcott isn\\'t just manipulative , he turns dora into his house slave . \\ndora\\'s unthinking devotion to alcott is the only whiff of basic human frailty to be found in loser , and even that isn\\'t explored in sufficient detail . \\nthere\\'s more ambiguity in the 30-second snippet from alan cumming\\'s broadway performance as the emcee in cabaret then there is in the rest of loser it\\'s one thing to turn supporting characters into comic exaggerations ; it\\'s another to flatten your leads into easily digestible mush . \\nand it would help if those comic exaggerations were somehow . . . \\ni don\\'t know . . . \\ncomic . \\nstill , i spent much of the film holding out the ridiculous hope that heckerling would somehow salvage loser from its tedium and justify my desire to like paul and dora . \\nthat hope dissolved the moment heckerling underscored a sequence of paul in the throes of unrequited love to simon and garfunkel\\'s \" scarborough fair/canticle . \" \\ninstead of giving the sequence a knowing wink-a reference to the graduate , a hint that paul is becoming an overly-sensitive clich-heckerling plays it deadly straight . \\neven in the scenes that scream for a light comic touch and a bit of a poke at her protagonist\\'s foibles , she finds it impossible to stray from the gospel of paul as saint . \\nclueless\\'s cher had her self-absorption and manipulative tendencies to balance her cuteness . \\nin loser , amy heckerling shows a leaden hand with material that demands friskiness ( her one show of wit involves naming paul\\'s dorm \" hunt\\'s hall \" after erstwhile bowery boy huntz hall ) . \\nher gift with casting proved to be her curse . \\nloser may be a crashing bore , but gee , aren\\'t those two kids swell ? \\n',\n",

       " b' \" a bug\\'s life \" may not be \" toy story , \" but it\\'s more close than \" antz \" was . \\ni really liked \" antz , \" basically because , yes , it is clever and witty and intelligent ( and it has the temerity to take a chance and put woody allen in the lead , perhaps the year\\'s most inspired casting ) , but there was , in fact , something missing from it , and i\\'m the first to admit that . \\nmaybe it\\'s that it never totally lets go and takes off into real innocent fun - it\\'s too obsessed with its orwellian message to become totally engaging , and if it weren\\'t for woody allen , it would have been just a really clever good-not-great flick . \\n \" a bug\\'s life \" has a similar premise , and it also has disney to insure that it\\'s g-rated and not totally over kids\\' heads like \" antz \" was ( not a bad thing , believe me ) , but what it also has is a tone that\\'s completely innocent even when it\\'s also remaining perpetually clever . \\n \" antz \" is still the more witty film , and i love it for it , and \" a bug\\'s life \" is more for general consumption , but it\\'s also more entertaining . \\nit broadens its horizons , and when it really moves from the ant colony , it really shows us a whole new world we\\'ve never seen before , and it\\'s take on the evolution of bugs is a lot better than the one in \" antz . \" \\nit\\'s also light and clever . \\nthe visuals are , instead of earth tones , bright worldly colors , and still gives the amazing visual technology of \" antz \" at least a worthy contender . \\nthe characters are also nicely realized - though watered-down for broad consumption , they still carry more wit than the contemporary disney animated films . \\nthe lead character , flik ( voiced by dave foley ) , is nothing more than a slightly-less neurotic z from \" antz , \" but foley makes him nearly as engaging as allen made z . instead of gene hackman playing the villain , we get the much more menacing kevin spacey as the lead grasshopper , the nicely-titled hopper . \\nand for the romantic lead , we don\\'t get spacey sharon stone , but intelligent and hard-to-get julia-louis dreyfuss , who doesn\\'t even come around until the very final frames . \\nnot that the plot\\'s really any better than the one in \" antz \" - it\\'s basically yet another redux of \" the seven samurai , \" with an ant colony under the control of giant grasshoppers forcing them to produce a product for them or else . \\nwhen flik , a bone fide inventor , creates a time-conserving apparatus that accidentally destroys the season\\'s donation , he puts them all in risk , and is sent away so that he won\\'t screw anything up with the pretense that he is searching for help to fight the grasshoppers . \\nhe runs into a group of \" warrirors \" who are , unbeknownst to him , a group of carnival bugs , and they agree to help under similar false pretenses . \\nthese bugs are an equally wonderful assortment to anything in \" toy story \" : foppish walking stick slim ( david hyde-pierce ) , german caterpillar heimlich ( joe ranft ) , quick-tempered and insecure male ladybug francis ( denis leary ) , pretentious praying mantis manny ( jonathan harris ) , his assistant butterfly hypsy ( madeliene kahn ) , spider rosie ( bonnie hunt ) , and two fleas , tuck and roll ( michael mcshane ) , who speak in undiscernable jibberish . \\nthe writers lightly touch on each bug\\'s place in bug society and the malleability thereof while making a wisecracks at everything they can , and blowing the audience away with wild visual treats . \\ngrasshoppers jumping in unison seems like a menacing earthquake . \\na small bird becomes an ominous mortal threat , whose usual mild-mannered squeal is a scream of death . \\nthe bug city is a modern-day metropolis , complete with fireflies temping as traffic lights and a fly sitting on the curb , holding out a cup , with a sign lying next to him that says \" kid tore off wings . \" \\nand a rainstorm is like a giant flood , with each drop acting like a small bomb dropped at millions of miles per hour . \\naround this , the pixar animators stage several large set pieces , like a resuce mission halfway through that is as wild and entertaining as anything this year , and a wonderfully exciting action piece at the end , a chase scene at night through the labyrinthine branches of a small thicket . \\nmeanwhile , each character gets the spotlight to be completely idisyncratic and interesting , something \" antz \" couldn\\'t do , and by the end , over the end credits , \" a bug\\'s life \" pulls it\\'s final punch , out clever-ing \" antz \" with a series of incessantly hilarious faux-bloopers that come just at the right time , when those who leave immeadiately after the final frame of a film have left , and you can brag that you were one of the elite who stayed and got the full money\\'s worth of entertainment . \\nstill , it\\'s no \" toy story . \" \\nthat film , maybe above any animated film i\\'ve ever seen , encompassed almost true perfection in story , character , and wit . \\nit proved that it didn\\'t need to brag about it\\'s cutting edge technology to really soar ( it\\'s the least visually striking of the three computer animated films thus far , but is still the most satisfying ) , and created a perfect world of idiosyncratic delights and innocent fun . \\nyet \" a bug\\'s life , \" as well as \" antz , \" are still amazing films , and prove without doubt , that if you\\'re gonna make a computer animated film , send it to the guys who created these three flicks , evne if they\\'re not working under the same roof . \\n',\n",

\\nprobably not . \\ntaken as allegory , however , it is representative of the treatment of the meek by the powerful in all facets of society . \\nmaybe it\\'s just the english major in me , but chad , in his motiveless cruelty towards christine and his careful manipulation of howard , can be seen as a symbol of unbridled capitalism , of greed without conscience . \\nthe entire film is a metaphor for social darwinism- only the strong will survive . \\nthe marvel of labute\\'s multi-layered script is that it can disturb each member of its audience in an entirely different way . \\nbut does the film work as entertainment ? \\nits darned funny in spots , particularly in the men\\'s room scenes , which demonstrate the lengths to which guys will go to hold a conversation while engaged in the most basic of bodily functions . \\nit works less well as drama , since by necessity the characters in an allegory tend to be flat ciphers . \\nstacy edwards gives a measured dignity to christine , and succeeds in making us care for her , but by the end of the film we still know nothing about her . \\nlikewise , chad and howard are simply the sum of their actions . \\nby the end of the film you\\'ll feel as if you\\'ve met a genuine monster in chad ; perhaps we can also classify men as a horror film . \\ncertainly those expecting a conventional hollywood resolution to the story will walk away disappointed . \\nbut the picture is often mesmerizing , and the script is a work of fine craftsmanship , which makes it well worth your time . \\nlike all good films , it offers a myriad of parallels to the outside world . \\nwhile watching chad in his moment of triumph , i couldn\\'t help but think that bill gates must have felt the same sort of cold , merciless satisfaction when he finally stuck it to steve jobs . \\nthere may be a little bit of chad in all of us , but some of us have taken chad-ness to the level of art . \\n',\n",

       " b'the sweet hereafter could serve as a textbook example of the difference between television movies and \" real \" movies . \\nconsider for a moment what a television producer would do with a book that features a fatal school bus accident and a lawyer out to sign up the bereaved -- lots of hot sensationalism interrupted with breaks to sell beer and toothpaste . \\ntop-flight writer and director atom egoyan delivers instead a film with tremendous power whose most notable trait is its touching subtlety . \\nbased on a respected book of the same name by author russell banks , the movie represents a rethinking of the story\\'s structure , not merely a literal adaptation of the novel . \\ntold in linear form by four narrators in the book , egoyan\\'s version happens instead in overlapping time sequences and without a narrator . \\nthe author is even on record as applauding egoyan\\'s changes . \\nin the press notes the book\\'s author describes the story as \" a parable of lost children . \" \\nhe says it asks what a town does in the absence of its children . \\npicking up on this , egoyan has a flashback in which a sitter , nicole burnell , played with grace by sarah polley , reads parts of \" the pied piper \" from an old , illustrated book to her two charges . \\nperiodically throughout the picture , nicole\\'s readings are heard in voice-over . \\nyou have never heard this moving poem read so sweetly or in such an appropriate moment . \\nthey and the rest of the town\\'s children come into harm\\'s way -- some live and others are seriously injured . \\nand the entire small canadian town where the accident occurs is never the same again . \\nalthough the physical damage is inflicted mainly on the children , the adults bear the emotional scars of the loss . \\nian holm , in arguably the best performance of his distinguished career , plays mitchell stephens , an intense man of quiet misery . \\nmitchell is the outsider in the story set in a small , snow-encrusted community in the british columbian wilderness . \\nhis mission there is a singular one , to sign up the parents so that he can sue someone , anyone , on their behalf . \\nif this seems crass , well it is , but mitchell approaches his job with the dedication of a religious zealot . \\nthe story unfolds slowly and always believably . \\neach little aspect has its own fascination . \\nas mitchell interviews wendell and rita walker , played with quiet realism by maury chaykin and alberta watson , he has a simple task . \\nhe wants them to suggest some model couple in the village who has a lost a child so that he can use that couple to form the basis of the suit . \\nwendell ticks off one town member after another and then , as one can in a small town , enumerates each person\\'s numerous faults . \\nalthough the town is no peyton place , people there do have their foibles . \\none of the best parents in the town appears to be billy ansell ( bruce greenwood ) , who rides his pickup behind the school bus everyday just so he can wave good-bye to his kids . \\nwell , single parent billy\\'s fault is that he has regularly scheduled trysts with the married rita . \\nhis confessions to rita about his feelings of loss are one of the many heartfelt outpourings in the story . \\nthe accident itself , a simple one of a bus hitting a patch of ice , isn\\'t shown until the middle of the picture , but , nevertheless , the mystery about it builds throughout the film . \\nalthough the picture is no detective story , finding out exactly what happened is a subtheme in a movie that is primarily a character study of a town gripped by tragedy . \\nas the injured bus driver , gabrielle rose , dolores driscoll plays the role of a dedicated individual who loves kids with a passion and for whom the tragedy takes on special meaning . \\nto round out the story , mitchell has his own private tragedy to bear . \\nhis daughter zoe ( caerthan banks ) is a drug addict who has bounced in and out of one half-way house and recovery center after another . \\nfond of calling her dad on his cell phone so she can ask for money or help , she interrupts him at many emotionally charged moments as he attempts to sign up the townsfolk . \\n ( \" i can help you , \" mitchell tries to reassure billy . \\n \" not unless you can raise the dead , \" billy snaps back . \\nmitchell\\'s pitch is never an easy one and worrying about zoe only makes it harder . ) \\nmychael danna\\'s haunting music sets the stage for tragedy . \\nthe cinematography by paul sarossy is sweeping in its outdoor grandeur , but it is in the warm , shadowy , intimate moments indoors where it works best . \\nthe show , which is ripe for emotional manipulation , never plays with its audience . \\nstill , when the house lights go up , you may feel as i did . \\ni could barely breathe ;

       " b'i\\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \\ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \\nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\\'t do that . \\nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\\'t quite do that either . \\na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\\'s \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\\'t do that . \\nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \\nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \\nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \\nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \\nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \\nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \\nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \\nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \\nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \\nstill , even with the cia\\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \\nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \\nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \\nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \\nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \\nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \\nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \\nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \\nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \\nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \\ni think it\\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \\nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \\nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\\'t even real ? \\nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \\n',\n",

       " b'm : i-2 , the sequel to mission impossible , is a james bond wannabe film , but it fails to even come close to that film in wit , humor , and entertainment value . \\nit tries to be a spy/romance movie , but without any suspense the film just looks like it\\'s an extended commercial for dudes who think they look cool in throwaway sunglasses . \\nit is a film that prefers techie gadgets to anything human . \\nthe coolest thing about this movie , was all the holes it had in its story and the most trite thing about the movie , was the usage of doves throughout as peace symbols . \\nthe film plays as if it was a wet fantasy dream about techie violence . \\nexcept for the choreographed action sequences , the film was dull for three-quarters of its time , filled with too many dead spots in its story to garner concern about its wooden characters or the superficial romance that developed . \\nas for the action scenes , they might look good to those who are converts to violence in their films , but their advertisement for sadistic responses , is nothing short of mindless cartoon violence , which makes it very difficult to sit back and applaud without feeling put off by the gratuitous cruelty seen . \\nm : i-2 opens and closes with fast-paced action scenes , but it is hard to get past the middle part which just drags on in banal dialogue . \\nthe film looks as if it had been invaded by a computer virus , at that point . \\nthe only thing that kept me awake , was the horrible music composed by hans zimmer that became very loud at any of the film\\'s supposedly momentous action scenes and seemed to make an uninteresting scene even more noticeable in the wrong way . \\nit\\'s a mega-buck film adapted from a popular high-tech gadgetry tv series . \\nbut its artistic success is an impossible task to accomplish because it hired the wrong director and actors to star in it , and it failed to produce a story that had any substance . \\njohn woo ( \" broken arrow \" / \" face/off \" ) is good at doing car chases , choreographed fights with midair flips and kung-fu kicks , slo-mo shots of two guns blazing , and of fire explosions , but he just can\\'t seem to handle dialogue and suspense . \\nthe star of the film and co-producer , tom cruise , and his romantic interest , thandie newton , are miscast . \\ncruise is no james bond and looks more like a yuppie than a superhero in his stylish long hair and innocuous smile , as he tries to carry off this macho role , while thandie is not an action-film girl , and seems like a fish- out-of-water in this one . \\ntheir romance didn\\'t work , not only was it tepid and not sexy , but it wasn\\'t convincing . \\nthe film opens with dizzying speed , perhaps with the hope that a befuddled audience is its best bet for success . \\nwe will be in three different locations instantaneously : sydney , the american southwest , and seville . \\nfirst , we are in sydney , australia , where a scientist with a muffled russian accent , dr . nekhorvich ( rade ) , mentions that he created a deadly killer virus called chimera and an antidote for it . \\nhe also mentions that every hero needs a worthy villain . \\nwhich explains the film\\'s mythic theme . . . as \\nwe enter the world of comic book myths on good and evil . \\nthe one who played the villain , dougray scott , does so in a one-dimensional gruff tone , which did not distinguish him in that role . \\nat least , if the film got the villain part right , it might have had some fun with this nonsense . \\nsoon the diabolical scientist is on a plane talking to someone he trusts called dimitri , but then the plane is taken over by terrorists who set it on automatic pilot and crash it into the rocky mountains . \\nbefore they crash the plane and parachute out of it , the one who was posing as dimitri , turns out to be sean ambrose ( scott ) , a rogue member of the imf , which is a cia-like clone . \\nhe steals the package with the antidote , peels off a latex mask , which is a replica of the hero of the story , ethan hunt ( cruise ) , who had posed as dimitri to the scientist before and had thereby gained his trust . \\nsean and his group of terrorists carry out this attack because they plan a virus plague on the world and then to sell the victims the antidote at marked up prices . \\nwe already saw the gimmick of peeling masks used in face/off and in the original mission impossible , which as convoluted a plot as that film had , it was still a superior film to this sequel . \\nwoo has run this peeling mask routine into the ground , as it is used so often in this film by both sides , so much so , that it blurs any ethical character differences between good guy or villain . \\nit makes it seem as if anyone could be another character , which distorts the reality of the film and makes it impossible for the film to make much sense . \\nnext we are in a mountain range in the american southwest , and ethan is on vacation , hanging by his fingertips while climbing and looking cool , when a helicopter with his boss anthony hopkins aboard , delivers via a rocket launcher , a pair of talking sunglasses . \\nhunt learns his next mission is to retrieve the chimera package and he is allowed to pick two regular imf agents to help , billy baird ( john polson ) and luther stickell ( ving rhames ) , with luther running a high-gadget computer , but he also must get a jewel thief named nyah hall ( thandie ) to join his team . \\nhe is told , as an incentive to recruit her , all her criminal charges will be dropped . \\nhopkins then signs off with the tag line : this message will self-destruct in five seconds . \\nactually , with the departure of hopkins , it was this disposable film that actually self-destructed at this point . \\nin seville , hunt recruits nyah into the team in the middle of a jewel heist and a subsequent car chase , where he nearly runs her audi sports car over the side of a mountain road . \\nhe also falls for her when this was only supposed to be a business deal , and learns that she is valuable because her ex-boyfriend was sean ambrose and that he still wants to f * ck her . \\nthe imf team then inject a location tracer chip into her to spot sean so she can go f * ck him , as she leads them to his hide-out in the seaside of australia in which he shares with his sneering villainous cohort , the south african , hugh stamp ( richard roxburgh ) . \\nrobert towne , the screenwriter , who contributed to the first \" mission , \" who is noted for doing \" chinatown \" -- writes a colorless , pedestrian script , one that fails even to be funny in a camp way . \\nthe terrorists , who aim to rule the world , are interested in owning 51 percent in a biotech company and in getting stock options , as they plan to infect sydney with the virus and have their company sell the antidote , insuring that they will make billions on the stock . \\nethan comes to the rescue of the world and of nyah , with his only conflict being who is more important to save first . \\nethan does this rescue against all odds , as he finds a way to penetrate a security tight biotech company , fight it out with sean and the other terrorists , and rescue nyah , who injected herself with the virus to hinder sean\\'s getting it , as the only way to transport the virus is through another person or from the vaccine needle . \\nethan rescues her by doing stunt riding on a motorcycle , using kick-boxing , winning a shootout , throwing a full john wayne supply of grenades at the terrorists , making some more use out of that peeling mask bit , and by being completely fearless and larger than life , while he kick\\'s everyone\\'s ass . \\nif i was only entertained by this . . . i \\ncould have lived with it . \\nbut this film was so badly made , that it was like watching a highlight film of a basketball game , seeing only the slam-dunks , but with the game itself being excluded from the telecast . \\nin any case , this is a critic-proof film , and will in all probability do well in the box office , as it was made to appeal to all the demographics who find commercial ventures like this one easy to buy into . \\n',\n",
       " b'the police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do . \\nlives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment\\'s notice . \\nthe negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower . \\nmost of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants . \\nit takes a pretty smart person to do that . \\nbut what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ? \\nwhat if he\\'s also able to think on his feet ? \\nin fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ? \\nit is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray\\'s the negotiator . \\nin this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force . \\nwhen his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman\\'s home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder . \\nfaced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain\\'s office . \\ni don\\'t quite remember if the captain actually said , \" i hate to do this , but . . . \" , \\nalthough it wouldn\\'t surprise me if he did . \\nluckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above . \\nafter being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed . \\nalthough roman\\'s actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue . \\njackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman . \\nthe actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats . \\nthe script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence . \\nhow can we believe he\\'s going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ? \\nunfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it\\'s would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson\\'s acting ability . \\nalmost every time he\\'s in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back . \\nwhen spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course . \\nhis is an interesting character . \\nmade out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation . \\n \" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can\\'t talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , \" he says . \\nwhen he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be . \\nsoon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail . \\nthis complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor . \\nas the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely . \\ngray really lucked out with this cast . \\ndavid morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey . \\nthe only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a . \\nin l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land . \\nwith the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven . \\nalso in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides . \\nhis character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything . \\nfortunately , this doesn\\'t distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout . \\nj . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances . \\nsadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film . \\nwalsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon . \\nfor one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton . \\nwhen jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) . \\nthe negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing . \\nin the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it\\'s reality . \\nwe\\'re served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best . \\nas an audience , we\\'re also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we\\'d like to see if one will dominate the film . \\nboth provide some pretty good entertainment . \\n',\n",

       " b\"it used to be that not just anyone could become a vampire . \\nusually , you had to be an aristocrat - a count such as dracula or karnstein . \\nto qualify , you'd have to have a modicum of sophistication , so you'd at least look cool - or suave - when biting into some young damsel's throat . \\nbut today , in our overly politically correct world , any scuzzy-looking , long-haired , unshaven lout or any spiked-haired harridans can put the bite on you . \\nby the same token , to be a vampire hunter , one had to have some sort of medical training and knowledge of the occult or maybe perhaps be some sort of professional soldier , or at least one who retired with honors . \\nnot in these times . \\nall you need are some sharp weapons , some bullets forged from silver and any yahoo can be a buffy - or a blade . \\nwithout sounding elitist , the fear of vampires has greatly diminished because of this lack of exclusivity . \\nwhich brings us to blade , the latest in a long line of vampire movies in which , it seems , half the population is putting the bite on the other half . \\nnot only are there thousands of vampires , but they seem to move from city to city , pay off police departments and , most importantly , establish their own exclusive after-hours raves in which the highlight is the sprinkler system going off and dousing all the occupants in a blood shower . \\nwith all that blood , you wonder why they have to hunt for victims . \\nyou also wonder when they get the time to get their clothes dry-cleaned and why no cleaner ever complains about all the bloodstains . \\nblade , which is based on a marvel comic book character , is , like a comic book , all visual . \\nthe plot is basically blade repetitiously slashing his way through the vampire army seeking their leader , deacon frost . \\nit's all hokum and nonsense , of course . \\nbut the filmmakers play it straight . \\nunfortunately , at least at the advance screening i attended , the audience didn't see it that way and laughed through much of the proceedings . \\nyou know a movie is in trouble when the scenes of blood and gore that should elicit screams of fright instead evoke peels of laughter . \\nanother tell-tale sign is when the audience seems to be admiring the hero's costume more than the hero . \\nalso it seems it's not enough for today's vampire merely to have fangs . \\nhe must also be proficient in the martial arts . \\nwhy a supernatural being , one of the undead , needs such skills is beyond me . \\n ( of course , this concept dates to the 1974 hammer films-run run shaw production of legend of the seven golden vampires , in which dracula is defeated by seven karate-chopping siblings . ) \\nwesley snipes is buff as blade . \\nhe growls his lines -the few he has - and spends most of the time glowering - as if he was suffering from indigestion or having second thoughts about starring in and co-producing this turkey . \\nblade is just another example of how the vampire film , a once honorable member of the horror family , has gone downhill . \\nthis dud mostly makes you yearn for those quaint old days when christopher lee could be stopped just by dangling a crucifix in his face . \\ntoday's vampires lack the panache , the style of a bela lugosi or a christopher lee . \\nthey are not even worthy enough to carry those great bloodsuckers' capes . \\nthey are more farcical than frightful . \\nthis whole enterprise is one dull blade that could have used lots of sharpening . \\n\",\n",

\\nwell , i imagine he didn\\'t have one . \\nthat\\'s why he feels like a plot device . \\nthis probably explains why neeson looks so hopeless in the role , and why he\\'s recently retired from film ( i don\\'t blame him , honestly ) . \\nobi-wan , a character i was really looking forward to learning more about , is even less interesting . \\nmcgregor has just a few lines , so anyone hoping to see the engaging young actor in a great performance is urged to look elsewhere . \\nsince these two men are the focus of the phantom menace , lucas has served us a big emotional void as the centerpiece of his movie . \\nthings start to pick up when our characters reach tatooine ; young anakin is perhaps the only truly fleshed-out character in the film , and lloyd does a thoughtful job with the role . \\ni was also hugely impressed with the sand speeder scene ; rarely is an action sequence so fast and so exciting . \\nand when anakin says goodbye to his mother , i found it moving . \\nalso fairly good is portman , and she manages to give a little depth to a character where no depth has been written . \\njar jar binks is one of the most annoying characters i\\'ve ever had to endure , but he\\'s more interesting than most of the humans . \\nas soon as the relatively-brief segment on tatooine is over , it\\'s back to the mind-numbing special effects and depthless action scenes . \\ni\\'ve seen many movies that qualify as \" special effects extravaganzas , \" but the phantom menace is the first one i\\'ve seen that had me sick of the special effects fifteen minutes into the movie . \\nthe reason is obvious : george lucas has no restraint . \\ni can\\'t say that i didn\\'t find the effects original , because i did -- the final battle between darth maul , obi-wan , and qui-gon is visually exceptional , as is most of the film . \\nbut i also found the effects deadening and tiresome . \\nmy breaking point was near the end of the picture , as anakin is getting questioned by yoda and the other jedi masters ; in the background , we see hundreds of digital spaceships flying around through a digital sky , and i wanted that to go away . \\ncan\\'t we have one stinking scene that isn\\'t bursting at the seems with a special effects shot ? \\ni got so sick of looking at the cgi characters and spaceships and planets and backgrounds that i really just wanted to go outside and look at a physical landscape for a few hours . \\nand then there\\'s the question of magic . \\nwhat was lost in the sixteen years between the phantom menace and return of the jedi ? \\ni have a feeling that lucas was so focused on how his movie looked that he forgot entirely the way it should feel . \\njohn williams\\' familiar score is no help , nor is lucas\\' direction . \\ni think it comes right down to characters : there are none here . \\ni longed for the magnetic presence of han , luke , and leia , but i got no such thing . \\nand what about the ridiculous expectations ? \\nmine weren\\'t that high ; i simply wanted a film that showed me the roots of the films that i grew up loving , a story that had a few characters and a few great special effects . \\ninstead , i got two hours and fifteen minutes of a lifeless and imaginative computer graphics show . \\ni don\\'t hate the phantom menace as much as i resent it : i\\'d like to forget that it exists , and yet i can\\'t . \\nit\\'s here to stay . \\ni can only hope that episodes ii and iii have something of substance in them , because if they don\\'t , then lucas will have pulled off the impossible task of destroying his own indestructible series . \\n',\n",

\\nnot only has cameron helmed the directorial duties of this film , he also wrote , produced , and edited it . \\nand to show his true faith for the project , he renenged all directing fees and percentage points to ease the budget costs . \\nit\\'s obvious he truly loves titanic . \\nthe film opens with footage , both real and fake , of an underwater excursion by special submarines to the bottom of the atlantic , where a team of explorers lead by bill paxton are searcing for a diamond called the \" heart of the ocean \" , which , according to bill paxton\\'s character , would be worth more than the hope diamond today . \\ntheir search turns up , dissapointly , no diamond , but instead a drawing of a young woman wearing the diamond . \\nthis picture is broadcast on cnn and is seen by a 101 year old woman named rose , who claims to be the girl in the picture . \\nshe is flown out to sea to meet bill paxton and to tell them about the diamond . \\nalmost all of the rest of the movie is her narration of the past . \\nrose\\'s narration shows us how she was an unhappy young girl , engaged to a rich man named cal hockley ( billy zane ) that she didn\\'t want to marry . \\nher mother is pushy and obnoxious , and cal hockley is arrogant . \\nthey are boarding the titanic , which is sailing to america , and this is where she is to marry cal . \\nmeanwhile , a young man named jack dawson ( leonardo dicaprio ) and his italian friend ( danny nucci ) win two 3rd class tickets aboard the titanic in a poker game . \\nthey are overjoyed , and rush aboard just as the boat is leaving . \\nfor them , this is their ticket to america , to a better life . \\nfor rose , she is sailing to her doom . \\nthe first hour and a half or so of titanic tells the story of how rose dewitt ( kate winslet ) and jack dawson fall in love . \\nit\\'s the classic wrong-side-of-the-tracks story , and does sometimes resort to a few cliches . \\nbut as i said above , the love portion isn\\'t sappy and doesn\\'t \" weigh the film down \" , as some critics have said . \\nit\\'s sweet , and it didn\\'t make me restless at all , despite the fact that i usually hate love stories . \\nof course , it might help that cameron introduces some pretty interesting characters to help keep our eyes glued to the screen . \\nmost of these people actually were passengers on the titanic back in 1912 , including the enigmatic molly brown ( played by the talented kathy bates ) , the captain of titanic ( bernard hill ) , and so on . \\nall of these characters add an extra depth to the film , and make it that easier to watch . \\nof course , things really start to get going after the hour and a half mark , where the titanic strikes the iceberg and begins a slow sink to the bottom . \\nthe sinking is depicted realisticly , and the effects are truly amazing . \\nit is not told in a heroic fashion sense either , as people are portrayed as panicking , pushing others aside to get on the limited lifeboats , and drowning and dying horrible deaths . \\nthe best part of the movie , in my opinion , comes at the very end , when we flash back to the future . \\nthe crew , who at first had been skeptical of rose\\'s story , now are totally aborbed by her . \\nrose goes out onto the ship\\'s ledge , and we then learn a secret about her that catches us off guard . \\nwe then see a dream of rose\\'s , in which she returns to the titanic and is dancing with jack dawson . \\nmost people i talked with after the movie saw this as only a dream . \\nhowever , i think it symbolized more ; i think it meant that rose had died , and is going to a sort of heaven , which would be the happiest part of her life : her and her one true love , jack . \\nif anyone has seen the movie and would like to voice an opinion about this , e-mail me at venom8@hotmail . com . \\n',\n",

       " b'the summer movie season is always the biggest and brightest season for movies throughout the year . \\nwe are introduced to blockbuster hits that are usually trashed by critics , loved by the people , and make tons of money at the box office . \\nthis year , the tradition continues with an update on the universal 1932 classic , the mummy . \\ni have always been a sucker for this kind of monster movies , and i always seem to be the only critic who really likes them . \\nthat tradition continues as well with this fun special effects extravaganza . \\nin the mummy , the up and coming brendan fraser stars as the adventurous explorer rick o\\'connell . \\nhe teams up with a curious , clumsy librarian named evelyn , played by rachel weisz , to find the mysterious city of the dead , hamunaptra . \\nevelyn loves egypt , and would truly like to visit the city that people call a fable . \\nrick has claimed he has been to hamunaptra during a battle , and that\\'s why she chose him to lead her there . \\nalso tagging along on the journey to the city of the dead is evelyn\\'s brother , jonathan , played by john hannah ( sliding doors ) . \\nnow in hamunaptra , the three uncover \" the book of the dead . \" \\nthe curious evelyn unlocks the book , reads from it , and now the body of the ancient egyptian imhotep ( arnold vosloo ) becomes alive and is out to kill the ones who opened and read from the book . \\nalong with imhotep arising from the dead , the ten curses of egypt become in full effect , launching unbelievable forces against the three and another group who set out to find hamunaptra . \\nnot only is imhotep furious with those who awoke him , he is also out to restore the life of his girlfriend that lost her life long ago in ancient egypt . \\ndon\\'t expect huge things out of the mummy , but just expect to have a good time . \\nthis movie is extremely campy and plays out like an old horror film with beefed up special effects , which may turn off some viewers . \\non the other hand , this type of film is one of my favorites , but that\\'s up to you to decide . \\nthere is one thing that definitely not campy or corny about the mummy though . \\nthe state of the art special effects take you into a completely different world . \\nwe are dazzled by faces rising out of the desert , swarms of beetles and locusts , and even creatures crawling under a human\\'s skin . \\nthese may have been in other movies before , but not like in the mummy . \\nas of now , the mummy holds the title for best special effects of this year , but all this could change when star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace is released into theaters across the country . \\nin the past , brendan fraser has played mainly comedic roles . \\nwhen playing \" george \" in disney\\'s george of the jungle , he was mainly not known by anyone . \\ni would say that gods and monsters is the film that gave him a name , and now the mummy will give him a name amongst teens . \\nin the mummy , fraser gets to play an action hero , and i liked him in this sort of role over the comedic role , as in the films blast from the past and george of the jungle . \\nalthough brendan fraser is great , rachel weisz gives the best performance among the cast . \\nweisz really reminded me of a character from an old , horror film . \\nthe way she acts , looked , and talked all reminded me of someone not from this time . \\nevelyn is probably the only character that was likable , considering that the other characters , like john hannah\\'s , didn\\'t get much personal attention . \\nin many films , when different genres are mixed , the mixing usually works , and i like it for the most part . \\nin the mummy though , not all of the mixing works . \\nthere are some scenes that have a lot of potential horror , some with potential comedy , some with potential drama , and some with potential pure action , but the film tries to mix them together too often for the mixing to work . \\nthe mummy could have gotten an \" a \" rating from me if it had gone purely with one of these . \\ni didn\\'t mind the corny one-liners here and there during action sequences , but it certainly could have done without them . \\nthe cinematography is amazing in the mummy . \\nparticularly in one scene depicting ancient egypt , we are taken into a very fun portrayal of egypt , mummies , and the treasures left behind by the ancient egyptians . \\nthe costume design in the film is also up there with the great cinematography . \\nfrom ancient egyptians outfits to original troops outfits , the costumes are always top notch . \\nthe bottom line- with the mummy , the summer is off to its usually great start . \\n',\n",

       " b\"to me , nicolas cage sounds like an ideal choice for the lead role in a martin scorsese film . \\ndespite the rantings that sean penn so rudely expressed , the actor remains a gifted and versatile screen presence . \\never since the big success of the action-thriller `face/off' in 1997 , the hollywood road has been a rocky one for mr . cage . \\nthe perpetually awful assassination thriller `snake eyes' was one of 1998's worst films . \\n`8mm' was a disappointing lost cause . \\nbut who better than scorsese to match cage's wit and intensity , which he does in miraculous fashion with `bringing out the dead' . \\ncage delivers one of his finest performances as frank pierce , a new york city emergency paramedic who is running on fumes from day-to-day . \\nafter five years of the stress-inducing job , frank basically just staggers onward , relying on heavy doses of caffeine and booze until his shift finally ends . \\nhe also begins seeing the ghosts of past patients who died under his care , namely a young girl named rose , who stares back at him with pale features at every street corner in new york . \\nfrank desperately wants to be fired , but his boss needs him to scour the city and help those in need ( `i'll fire you tomorrow . . . ' he promises ) . \\nfrank is accompanied by a fresh face every night in the ambulance . \\nthe first is larry ( john goodman ) , who always has food on the brain . \\nthe second is marcus ( ving rhames ) , a deeply religious black man who incorporates the power of jesus into a regular rescue operation . \\nand finally , tom ( tom sizemore ) is a deranged sociopath hungry for blood . \\ni found it unique how scorsese used each of these characters for a single shift with frank , but they never figured into the actual plot . \\neach is merely a colorful presence to help develop frank's character , because `bringing out the dead' is predominantly a study of his mind and detailed personality . \\nthe one character alongside frank that truly comes into play is mary ( patricia arquette ) , the daughter of a newly admitted patient who suffered from a severe heart attack . \\narquette , who recently received the wounds of christ in `stigmata' , performs well around real-life husband cage . \\nit's unfortunate that , after such intriguing character trials and tribulations , the relationship between frank and mary slips during a mishandled , ineffective finale . \\nthe movie belongs to the one-two punch of cage and scorsese , who were born to collaborate their efforts in an arrangement similar to `bringing out the dead' . \\nalthough it certainly lacks the grit and hard-edge of something like `goodfellas' , scorsese manages to hit a nerve with his latest picture . \\nthe incredible camera-work and photography represent stunning flashes of brilliance in an otherwise unspectacular conglomeration . \\nfans will be pleased to find the director has returned to his abrasive , darkly humorous roots after somewhat of a departure with 1997's `kundun' . \\ndoes `bringing out the dead' rival scorsese's finest work ? \\nonly occasionally . \\nsome of the film feels surprisingly limp , but there is enough energy in it's interesting material and breathtaking visual appearance to suffice . \\nthose expecting a grisly , risqu ? product may be somewhat disheartened at the fairly straight-arrow approach - but it's still a solid , admirable effort . \\n`bringing out the dead' was written by the acclaimed paul schrader , who collaborated with scorsese on such classics as `taxi driver' and `raging bull' . \\nschrader's script is full of moments - wonderful , sharply defined moments - that are sorted throughout the remainder of his meandering screenplay . \\nthe exceptional aspects of the film are it's astounding technical credits and the amazing cast . \\ngoodman and sizemore are both electric ( well , mainly sizemore ) , but it's the phenomenal ving rhames who deserves a second look . \\nwatch the actor's deeply inspired dedication as he resurrects a gothic band member , and you'll understand why he won a golden globe . \\n`bringing out the dead' is raw and electrifying often enough to mask it's certain flaws . \\nscorsese - and cage , for that matter - have done better , but their intentions are certainly admirable . \\n\",\n",

) \\napril\\'s parents , feeling like there is no recourse , call in a favor to president clinton and send a nuclear bomb ( whose circuitry inexplicably is made up of a homosexual performer ) their way . \\nthe bomb is a dud thanks to the work of the \" circuitry \" and they re-wire it and send it back to washington d . c . , destroying it . \\nmr . and ms . pfferpot give up trying to get their daughter back and instead decide to join her as they have some alternative sexual practices of their own . \\ni\\'m not sure if writer/director/co-star jeff b . harmon was purposely trying to offend people because he believes in some of the ideas his movie presents or if he was just going for cheap laughs . \\neither way , he manages to present some of the most offensive material i have ever seen in a movie . \\nthe film opens with a preacher running a small african-american child out of town , and then later moves on to the hanging of a michael jackson impersonator by the ku klux klan ( during a jaunty musical number ) , preceded by remarks about \" gays and straights finally being able to put their differences behind them and work together to hate others , such as the jews \" . \\nif harmon was merely trying to point out how idiotic society can be , then i apologize for being so harsh on elements of his film , but it is presented so mean spiritedly that i can\\'t help but feel like he had some serious intent . \\nas for the entire central theme of the movie , i\\'m afraid that it\\'s one that i just don\\'t get . \\ni tried to keep an open mind while watching it , but the homosexual elements were just too prevalent for my tastes . \\nit was hard enough to watch them bash other races and sexes without them preaching about the virtues of being homosexual and accepted by society . \\nhow does one expect to be accepted if they are just as guilty of non-acceptance ? \\ni\\'m not prone to judging anyone and i believe that people should be free to explore whatever avenues they wish free from the scornful eye of society , but don\\'t force your particular rhetoric down my throat if you aren\\'t going to show the same respect for my preferences that you wish from me . \\nagain , maybe i\\'m missing the satirical point that harmon is trying to make , but if so , i think it could have been handled a little more tactfully . \\nas far as musical comedies go , isle of lesbos is no trey parker and matt stone musical , but a good portion of the songs are maddeningly catchy . \\ndespite the disturbing visuals , \" mom and apple pie \" stuck with me for the rest of the day . \\nspeaking of disturbing visuals , \" wedding bells ain\\'t ringing \" could have been a decent song , but the accompanying visuals of spousal abuse are more harrowing than this film should be displaying . \\n \" i\\'m a lesbian \" ( which is touted in the press release as being particularly popular ) is also pretty good , but a good portion of that could be due to the stellar singing voice of ms . smith . \\nit\\'s mainly on her excellent vocals that my rating of this film is based . \\nthe other performers are decent , save for the rosie o\\'donnell like performance given by danica sheridan . \\ni have no inherent problem with her character ; it is just her singing voice that leaves little to be desired . \\none particular musical number , \" lesbian rock \" , was one of the lowest points i have ever experienced in my film-going life thanks to a strained and lackluster vocal job by sheridan . \\nthe film ends about twenty minutes before the credits actually roll . \\nthe remainder of the running time is padded out with a few more songs ( \" lesbian rock \" included ) and the ridiculously presented anti-nukes message tacked on to the end for no reason other than to make it a feature length film . \\nonce the \" isle of lesbos reprise \" was reached , i felt the story had already been wrapped up well enough to end it all . \\nwhy was the film needlessly stretched out past its obvious end ? \\nisle of lesbos is available on videocassette from www . indie-underground . com . \\nthe transfer is pretty clean ( and all the detail of the wrinkled cloth and paint backdrops are readily apparent ) and the film is letterboxed at approximately 1 . 85 : 1 . \\nin many respects , isle of lesbos has incredible cult potential ( like a rocky horror for the new millennium ) . \\nthis film is by no means my cup of tea , but i know there are those out there who will enjoy it . \\nif you think it might be for you , then by all means seek it out . \\ni , on the other hand , will be cleansing my palette with a good action film like gladiator . . . \\nwait . aren\\'t gladiator films considered to be . . . \\noh , never mind . \\n',\n",

       " b'boy , what a great movie ! ! \\nkeanu reeves and morgan freeman acting together , the director of the fugitive ( andrew davis ) back again to give us another thriller , and the beautiful rachel stealing beauty weisz thrown in to boot . \\nhow could this not be a blockbuster ? \\nall die-hard keanu reeves fans , read on . \\nol \" much ado about nothing \" plays eddie kasalivich , a machinist studying at the university of chicago . \\nto help pay for the rent , he takes on this job making the machinery for a hydrogen project being conducted by the university . \\nby happy coincidence , he also happens to stumble on the solution to the final problem and thus is the only one who knows the key to performing this feat of miracle physics . \\nthis project holds great promise : taking hydrogen from water and giving out more energy than is put in . \\na potential solution to the earth\\'s energy problems without the pollution cost . \\nsurely nobody could have any problems with that ? \\nmorgan freeman is paul shannon , the project\\'s sponsor . \\nhe works for a very powerful organization that disagrees with the paternal project leader as to how quickly technology should be released to the public . \\nhe figures the world will disintegrate into anarchy if the results of the project are released too quickly . \\nso he murders the project leader , blows up the project ( great but short scene here , sort of like a mini id4 city-devastation thing ) and tries to simulate the experiment at some other hi-tech hush-hush location . \\nunfortunately , our intrepid machinist and an english physicist ( weisz ) manage to get away and now follows a fugitive-like chase using a not too dissimilar rehash of that movie script . \\nthis movie is just dying for a comparison with \" the fugitive \" . \\nboth movies use chicago as the main city and since the place doesn\\'t change much , i guess we can\\'t really blame the setting for the paucity of atmosphere . \\nthe trouble here is that where the fugitive had harrison ford and tommy lee jones , chain reaction only has keanu reeves and fred ward . \\ncredit to them , but we aren\\'t really given much of a chance to empathise with the characters . \\nwhere ford was able to work within the confines of the movie to evoke sympathy , eddie kasalivich just doesn9t seem very believeable and reeves\\' character is never given the time to develop . \\nit might have been a better investment in film to give the characters more depth and spend less time on the chase sequences , which frankly , get quite boring after a while . \\nharrison ford was \" the man against the world . \" \\nhe was alone in a world where he didn\\'t know who to trust and it came across real well . \\nin chain reaction , keanu reeves isn\\'t alone . \\nnow that would be fine if the fleeing couple had some chemistry and could really portray some paranoia , vulnerability and confusion . \\nwe don\\'t get this . \\nwe get him thinking he\\'s still in speed , only now our sandra bullock has an english accent , probably doesn\\'t drive a bus , and hardly contributes anything to the movie . \\nthe producers here probably thought , \" hey , what if keanu and rachel don\\'t hit it off too well ? \\nlet\\'s rope in that morgan to help us out . \" \\nwell , keanu and rachel didn\\'t hit it off well on the screen , and most unfortunately , morgan freeman doesn\\'t help much either . \\nthe only thing we come to really know of paul shannon is that he always has a full load of cigars in his cigar holder . \\nit\\'s not really his fault . \\nonce again , andrew davis just doesn\\'t take the time to build his characters . \\nsomeone must have convinced him that this time round , cinema dollars are best earned by making the movie run like a headless chicken . \\nthe flying inkpot rating system : * wait for the tv2 broadcast . \\n * * a little creaky , but still better than staying at home with gotcha ! \\n * * * pretty good , bring a friend . \\n * * * * amazing , potent stuff . \\n * * * * * perfection . \\nsee it twice . \\n',\n",
       " b'as we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment , hollywood doesn\\'t loose the oppertunity to get involved , by telling stories and expressing opinions . \\nthis film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels , hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) . \\nthey fought side by side in vietnam , where childers saved hodges\\' life by shooting an unarmed pow . \\nthat\\'s against the rules of war but understandable , in this story anyway , under the specific circumstances . \\ncertainly hodges is not complaining . \\nyears pass . \\nhodges , whose wounds make him unfit for action , gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer . \\nchilders , is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould . \\nbecause of his excellent record , childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley ) , cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops . \\nchilders does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command . \\nafter three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire , he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd . \\nmore than 80 yemeni men , women , and children are mowed down . \\nchilders is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians . \\nhe persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film . \\ndid childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ? \\nor are there simply no rules in war ? \\nthe answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious , but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions . \\nthe murder of 83 \" innocent civilians \" has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ? \\nwhere is the u . n . ? \\nthe film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ? \\nthis film ( in a way akin to films such as \" a few good men \" ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism . \\nthese accusations are pretty heavy , but also unfair . \\nwhat director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking . \\none of the earliest apparent problems with \\'rules of engagement\\' is its lack of credibility . \\nthe entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now , but is overdone , contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed . \\na lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality . \\nthat is precisely why it\\'s not offensive . \\nit is completely unobjective . \\nmany stories are started and never finished . \\nmany questions are asked , but never answered . \\na lot of parallels are referring to nothing . \\nit seems that neither the director , producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film . \\nis it about arab mentality ? \\namerica\\'s foreign policies ? \\namerica\\'s role in the world ? \\ncorruption in the higher circles ? \\nit goes on and on . \\nit consists of countless stories , but not a definable plot . \\nit tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one . \\ni think that it is ironic , because director william friedkin\\'s probably most acclaimed film was \" the exorcist \" which had a silly story , but became a rather effective film . \\nin this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film . \\nthough several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes ) , his latest film does simply not engage . \\ni believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed . \\nit\\'s obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe . \\nthe characters feel designed , unreal , merely shadows , with no life outside the conflict . \\neven the actors can not save this film from going under . \\nthough both jackson and jones act admirably , with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this , it is not something that these great actors can boast of . \\nthey have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back . \\njackson is gray and jones uninteresting . \\nthe rest of the cast , including ben kingsly , blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks . \\nthe time has come for the verdict . \\non the charges of complete lack of objectivity , i find this film guilty . \\non the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking , i find it guilty . \\nbut on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty , because of it\\'s inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere , not only when concerning the arab population . \\ni must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far , portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys . \\nthis is very sad , since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth . \\nhowever , it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states . \\nand that it\\'s not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east , including yemen are on constant maximum alert . \\n',\n",

       " b'american pie 2 is filled with laughs . \\nbut they are mostly cheap ones built primarily upon sexual degradation and adolescent humor more fit for a locker room than a movie theater . \\ni\\'m no prude and i admit to laughing along with everyone else at the preview screening to this sequel to the 1999 hit comedy . \\nbut the laughs are built on discomfort and embarrassment , not on any intrinsic humor from within the story itself . \\nwhat separates american pie 2 from its predecessor is heart . \\nof the original , i noted it was \" a warm , pleasant outing about the travails of growing up . \" \\nwell , the quartet of chums - jim ( jason biggs ) , oz ( chris klein ) , kevin ( thomas ian nicholas ) and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) - have grown up . \\nat least they are a year older , but don\\'t seem any wiser . \\nfresh from their first year of college the quartet , along with the obnoxious stifler ( seann william scott ) , rent a summer house by the lake in order to attract girls in an attempt to score . \\nas usual nothing goes right until the last reel . \\nbut what we are left with is five guys spending nearly two hours drooling over various young women . \\nand american pie 2 is rather degrading to women . \\nfor the most part , they are not shown as individuals . \\nthey are nothing more than potential recipients of over-active , raging hormones . \\nit is telling that the most normal couple , oz and heather ( mena suvari ) spend the bulk of the film trying to have phone sex - she\\'s overseas on an exchange student program . \\ndespite having been to college , jim is still klutzy and awkward , unsure of himself around the opposite sex . \\nmost of the pratfalls and humiliations are heaped upon him , including a painful episode involving an instant glue-like substance . \\nalso uncomfortable to watch is a sequence involving three of the lads with two young women roommates , whom the boys suspect of being lesbians . \\nit is offensive and plays upon outdated , adolescent stereotypes to generate laughs . \\nthe first film , despite some raunchy moments , had an innocent charm to it . \\nthe sequel is more cynical . \\nit knows what its predominantly male audience members want and unabashedly gives it to them : the many mentions of finch\\'s encounter with stifler\\'s mom becomes a tiresome running gag throughout as does eugene levy\\'s return as jim\\'s well-meaning , trying-to-be-hip dad . \\nthe only performer who is actually given some new , fresh material is alyson hannigan as michelle , the band geek from the original . \\nin the sequel , she imbues her character with vulnerability , wisdom and maturity . \\namerican pie 2 is a pre-sold commodity that will earn several million at the box office . \\nit is a shame , though , that in its rush to rake in some bucks screenwriter adam herz , who also penned the original , could not have set his sights higher . \\namerican pie 2 is funny , but it\\'s still a comedown as well as a letdown . \\n',\n",

\\neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \\nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \\nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in

       " b\"synopsis : two con artists find the perfect patsy in harry ( woody harrelson ) - - an inept former journalist who trips and bumps his head into a post , tries to slap a girl and gets poked in the eye , has ill-timed fits of coughing , and fails at everything he does . \\nthe story is told from harry's point of view . \\nharry always carries around a shot of whiskey although he swears he doesn't drink . \\none day harry is approached by the con girl rhea ( elisabeth shue ) , who is similar to harry in that she carries around a cigarette but swears she doesn't smoke . \\nseduced , harry agrees to participate in a money-making scheme involving faking the kidnapping of odette ( chloe sevigny ) , the teenage daughter of a rich man . \\nturns out , it's all part of a needless , very puzzling , extremely elaborate and convoluted scheme ( it involves hiring special impersonators ) by two cons in order to fool harry , a hero who barely has the intellectual capacity of a wooden post . \\nwhen the 'kidnapped' odette is found dead , the clues point to harry as the kidnapper/murderer , and the police are hot on harry's trail . \\nharry suddenly realizes he has been framed while others have taken the ransom money . \\ncan he get out of this mess ? \\nopinion : palmetto is a long , uninteresting film with all the wrong feel . \\nhero harry is an inept bungler who trips up often and consistently overestimates his own intelligence . \\nthis farcical kind of character works best in an entertaining naked gun action comedy or dragnet spoof . \\nbut palmetto is played like a dark , serious , detective noir drama , and watching harry's bumbling confidence amounts to an irritating distraction . \\nthere's a lapse in concentration in the middle of the movie as the camera goes wild on breasts , buttocks , short skirts , colored painted nails , and women's legs . \\neven when the focus is supposedly on harry and his dilema , you can always notice the side of elizabeth shue's breast forming a prominent foreground . \\ntowards the end , palmetto re-focuses on plot for the grand finale - - a confusing explanation involving impersonators , with woody harrelson handcuffed and suspended over a tub of acid as he hears the criminals' confession . \\nif you can imagine 'shemp' from the three stooges playing the detective hero of an hbo 'lingerie suspense' thriller , that's how out of synch this movie feels . \\n\",\n",

       " b'i must admit i\\'m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \\nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \\ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \\nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \\nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \\nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \\nthe story of serendipity is simple . \\ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \\ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \\nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \\nsara declares that if this \" thing \" -- let\\'s just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \\nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \\nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that \" thing \" was right after all . \\nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \\ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \\nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \\non the flipside , films such as you\\'ve got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film\\'s main journey at hand . \\nbut it\\'s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \\n',\n",

he also penned the wonderful sleeper , mystic pizza . \\nthe film , like the play , is set in atlanta , georgia , and it revolves around two people in their twilight years : a cranky , 70-something jewish widow who feels guilty about her wealth and a 60-something black man who becomes her chauffeur . \\nthe movie relies on character , rather than plot , to propel the action . \\nin fact , the movie has no discernible plot in the traditional sense ; it doesn\\'t present a linear story in which all the scenes flow together . \\nrather , driving miss daisy is made up of the routine activities of everyday life : shopping , listening to the radio , visiting the cemetery , eating fried chicken , and so on . \\nthe film also incorporates into the story line actual events in atlanta\\'s history , including the 1958 bombing of the temple ( the city\\'s oldest jewish congregation ) and a 1965 ceremony honoring the reverend dr . martin luther king , jr . \\nthe story begins in 1948 with daisy ( tandy ) crashing and wrecking her packard as she pulls out of her driveway . \\nthe insurance company cancels her insurance , and her son , boolie , decides to hire her a chauffeur . \\nfreeman , reprising his role from the play , plays the chauffeur , hoke . \\nthe film chronicles the warm friendship that slowly but surely blossoms between the chauffeur and his reluctant passenger . \\ndriving miss daisy is a movie about human nature , aging , prejudice , and a great many other things , but more than anything it\\'s about a relationship : one that spans 25 years , 4 cars , the advent of civil rights , and one gravely important 33 cent can of salmon . \\ndaisy is strong-willed and set in her ways , and , from the outset , she is utterly opposed to the idea of having a chauffeur . \\ninitially , she treats hoke with contempt , refusing to let him drive her anywhere . \\nonce she does get in the car , daisy is the ultimate back-seat driver . \\nto make matters worse , she is extremely self-conscious about what others might think if they were to see her being escorted around town by a hired hand . \\neventually , however , daisy is worn down by hoke\\'s good-natured charm and infectious cheer ; she softens and opens up to him . \\ntandy plays the part of daisy exceedingly well , but unfortunately this feisty , cantankerous character is just a smidgen too commonplace . \\nwe\\'ve seen this woman countless times before in other incarnations , from on golden pond to cocoon . \\nnevertheless , tandy manages to put enough of a personal stamp on the familiar character to make it her own . \\nfreeman , as hoke , on the other hand , gives the more distinctive of the two performances . \\nthere is something profoundly moving about the way hoke maintains his pride and dignity in a society which forbids him from using public rest rooms because of his skin color . \\nhoke is uneducated and illiterate , but freeman always suggests that there is something more to this man , an inner strength beneath the simpleton exterior . \\nboth freeman and tandy seem to be in their element , in full command of their natural charisma . \\nthey flirt with the camera and dominate scenes without overtly calling attention to themselves . \\nthey bring a light touch to their humorous banter and to the movie\\'s gentle humor . \\nat the same time , tandy and freeman provide more than a few moments of truly poignant drama . \\nin his first dramatic role , dan aykroyd is surprisingly chubby and unexpectedly effective as boolie , tandy\\'s loving and patient son . \\ndrama seems to agree with aykroyd ; taking a break from comedy seems like a good move for the actor , especially when you consider the wretched comedies he has made recently ( ghostbusters ii , the great outdoors , my stepmother is an alien ) . \\nthe only other significant characters in the film are daisy\\'s housekeeper , idella , marvelously played by esther rolle ( \" good times \" ) , and boolie\\'s pretentious wife , played by patti lupone . \\nunder the direction of bruce beresford ( crimes of the heart , tender mercies ) , driving miss daisy seems a bit stagey now and again . \\nbut fortunately , beresford never forgets he\\'s shooting a movie , and accordingly , he offers plenty of striking cinematic touches , such as gorgeous shots of flowers , trees , and tomatoes . \\nin adapting driving miss daisy from the stage to the screen , the filmmakers have achieved a delicate subtlety . \\nuhry understands that what his characters do not say can be just as important as what they do say . \\nberesford wisely exercises restraint in the film\\'s dramatic moments . \\nthe movie tugs at your heart , but it never goes for the jugular . \\nthe only sap in driving miss daisy is in the trees . \\n',\n",

       " b'ralph fiennes is carving out a nice niche for himself in the genre of period piece romances . \\nfor his followup to the academy-beloved the english patient , he has once again turned to a love story , this time directed by accomplished australian film maker gillian armstrong ( little women ) . \\ndespite some obvious overplotting , oscar and lucinda is a mostly effective and often affecting motion picture that touches our hearts while daring our minds to balk at its implausible coincidences . \\nthe film opens in the mid-1800s , with parallel storylines in new south wales , australia and devon , england . \\nas the helpful narrative voice of geoffrey rush informs us , lucinda leplastrier ( cate blanchett ) is a headstrong young woman being raised in the australian outback . \\nmeanwhile , half the world away , oscar hopkins ( fiennes ) has broken with his puritanical father over religious issues , and has gone away to school to study to be an anglican priest . \\nlucinda is fascinated with glass ; oscar is obsessed with theology . \\nlucinda is rich ; oscar is poor . \\nlucinda is forward and self-assured ; oscar is timid and uncertain of himself . \\nyet one characteristic unites these two diverse individuals -- the compulsion to gamble , whether it\\'s on horses , dogs , cards , or the flip of a coin . \\nand fate has decreed that they will one day meet . \\nthat day doesn\\'t occur until 45 minutes into the film , when oscar boards a ship bound for sidney , australia , where he hopes to change his life and minister to anyone in need of his help . \\nanother of the passengers is lucinda , who is returning from england where she was shopping for machinery to equip her newly-acquired glassworks factory . \\nat first , their relationship is that of a reverend and a confessor , but it doesn\\'t take long for both of them to recognize a kindred spirit in the other . \\na friendship is born , and , once they reach australia , it develops into something more potent . \\nbut oscar is uncertain of lucinda\\'s affection , and feels he must do something to prove himself worthy of her . \\noscar and lucinda isn\\'t beyond a little manipulation to get the desired emotional response , and there are times when the storyline curves in preposterous directions . \\non more than one occasion , it\\'s apparent that events are occurring specifically to funnel the characters into a position where there is only one possible route . \\ncoincidence is a crucial plot device ; without it , this movie can\\'t go anywhere . \\nthe voiceover narration ( never one of my favorite techniques ) is too verbose and breaks into the story at undesirable moments . \\n ( however , without it , the final twist , which i will not reveal , would not be as poignant . ) \\nyet , despite these quibbles , i enjoyed oscar and lucinda . \\nstoryline faults pale in the light of two such finely-realized characters . \\nthematically , the film is also strong . \\nthe unifying motif -- that everything in life is a gamble -- is successfully delineated . \\noscar and lucinda don\\'t just wager their money , they bet their hearts , minds , and souls . \\na card game they engage in shortly after they first meet could easily be considered a form of emotional \" strip poker \" where defenses are peeled away to reveal their shared , secret passion . \\noscar does not see gambling as a vice . \\nin fact , he believes that the greatest chance one takes in life is betting one\\'s immortal soul on the truth of a religious faith . \\nralph fiennes , who normally plays strong , confident men , is very much at home as the fumbling , insecure oscar . \\nthe actor brings a variety of nervous tics to the part , all of which subtly add to a vague sense of discomfort whenever oscar is on-screen . \\nas good as fiennes is , however , he is eclipsed by cate blanchett . \\nthe actress , who appeared earlier this year as one of the leads in bruce beresford\\'s paradise road , is mesmerizing as lucinda . \\nshe gives this liberated woman her flash , and feeds the chemistry between the two lead characters so that it sparkles rather than fizzles . \\neffective support is provided by ciaran hinds ( the male lead in jane austen\\'s persuasion ) as lucinda\\'s close friend , tom wilkinson ( the full monty ) as oscar\\'s mentor , and clive russell as a self-serving adventurer . \\nthere\\'s a real magic in the way armstrong develops the story , keeping things moving in unexpected directions without lingering too long on any one moment or sequence . \\n ( in fact , i wish she had devoted a little more time to the luminous middle act , which has oscar and lucinda together . ) \\nwith the skill of a consummate storyteller , she weaves romance , friendship , passion , humor , and tragedy together into a complete package . \\nthe characters , with all of their human foibles and neuroses , are wonderfully developed by fiennes and blanchett . \\nso who cares if the storyline is a little ripe and unwieldy ? \\noscar and lucinda still offers abundant pleasures to reward the viewer . \\n',\n",

       " b'if there were a subject just screaming to be made into a film , it was studio 54 , the late steve rubell\\'s infamous new york discotheque , which came to symbolize the taboo-smashing excesses of the disco era\\'s heyday : easy drugs and even easier sex between everyone , all set to a thumping dance beat . \\nso when miramax started production on _54_ last year , the buzz of hype and resulting anticipation began : an edgy film as down-and-dirty as the club itself , written and directed by a promising first-timer ( mark christopher ) and starring some hot young talent ( salma hayek , neve campbell , newcomer ryan phillippe , and mike myers in his dramatic debut ) . \\nmy , how easily does the worm turn . \\nhype turned into damage control when word got out about 11th-hour reshoots ( wrapped only a month ago ) , a rash of studio-imposed edits that left virtually the entire cast and crew ( especially christopher ) unhappy , and the very likely possibility that miramax would not screen the finished film for critics . \\nat the last minute , though , miramax did decide to screen the film ( so hastily scheduled was the screening that myers\\'s last name was misspelled on the invitation , not to mention the numerous typos in the press notes ) for a media audience that came away noticeably less than impressed , myself included . \\nand with good reason--somehow , some way , the supremely disappointing _54_ has made the historically hip haven of hedonism . . . \\nboring . \\nalthough christopher has distanced himself from the finished film , he still must shoulder some of the blame for _54_\\'s lifelessness . \\n_54_ focuses , for the most part , on a tight-knit trio of employees at the club : coat check girl/aspiring disco diva anita ( a wasted hayek ) ; her busboy husband , greg ( breckin meyer ) ; and , most prominently , the fresh-from-jersey shane o\\'shea ( phillippe ) , who enjoys a quick rise from busboy to head bartender . \\nthese characters are about as generic as those descriptions . \\nin focusing on the hired help , christopher really missed the boat . \\nwith the exception of the flamboyant , always-woozy rubell ( myers , in a well-modulated turn ) , the meaty stories to be told at studio 54 are not the workers\\' but those of the people who went there to party ; not necessarily the numerous vip guests , but the wild eccentrics who managed to be picked from the crowd by the club\\'s famously hard-ass doormen and dance ( among other things ) the night away with the rich , famous , and infamous ( the only taste of the crowd comes by way of ellen dow\\'s feisty dottie , a disco- and drug-crazed granny , but she\\'s a peripheral character at best ) . \\nas such , aside from the expected overhead crowd shots , there is precious little actual _dancing_ in _54_ . \\nwhat is a disco film--especially one about the pinnacle of the movement--without the dancing ? \\neven whit stillman\\'s _the_last_days_of_disco_ , which wasn\\'t so much concerned with disco as it was witty dialogue within a group of hip-to-only-themselves club-hopping preppies , featured at least one extended dance scene . \\ndancing isn\\'t the only thing glazed over in _54_--so is the sex , but that may not be entirely christopher\\'s fault . \\nfrom what i\\'ve heard , his original vision was something considerably more dark and daring , starting with the shane character : he was conceived ( and actually filmed ) as a wild , morally ambiguous bisexual , which would have made an efficient springboard to cover the pansexual pleasure palace aspect of studio 54\\'s legend . \\nbut somewhere between principal photography and the final cut , shane was defanged and quite literally straightened out ; consequently , so was the film . \\naside from a brief glimpse of erotic encounters toward the beginning of the film , shane\\'s fleeting dalliance with seductive socialite billie ( sela ward ) , and an abbreviated bedhopping montage , the sexual dimension is just about ignored . \\nshane , in this incarnation , is sanitized to the point of blandness , an idealistic do-gooder who pines for a frequent guest at the club , julie black ( campbell ) , a worldly soap star with , yes , a heart of gold . \\nthis tacked-on \" romance \" would have been slightly less tedious if either campbell or phillippe made some connection with each other or the audience . \\nthey fail on both counts . \\nultimately , _54_\\'s failure comes down to three letters : f-u-n . \\nas in , there isn\\'t any to be had for the audience . \\ntoo much time is spent with the boring shane , and too little is spent on the club floor , where all the action took place . \\nanyhow , though , whatever time is spent on the 54 floor is not used very effectively . \\nwhen anita finally gets her big break and perform onstage at the club , it should be a euphoric height , for her , the crowd , and the audience ; however , the moment doesn\\'t get a chance to reach that level , for it is cut short by a moment of forced sentimentality , which also mars the film\\'s conclusion ( one of the last-minute reshoots ) . \\nstrangely upbeat and wistful , the resolution is wholly unconvincing and unsatisfying . \\nthere is an interesting portrait of studio 54 out there--two of them , in fact--but _54_ is not one of them . \\nthey\\'re on cable tv : a couple of documentaries produced by e ! and vh1 . \\nthese two fascinating looks at the club and all the sordid goings-on within it show that there\\'s still a great disco movie to be made . \\nthe problem is , after the critical and certain box office failure of _54_ , the subject may have run its hollywood course . \\n',\n",

       " b'scream 2 has a titillating little scene that lays down the unwritten law of horror movie sequels quite well . \\nduring a film-class discussion , windsor college students articulate what these inevitable laws are , and why sequels never live up to the originals . \\na few rare exceptions are noted , but they left out one . \\n . \\n . \\nscream 2 ! \\n1996\\'s surprise horror blockbuster scream became an instant hit and developed an obsessive coterie of fans which included almost every teenager in america ! \\na sequel was unavoidable , but luckily the re-teaming of writer kevin williamson and director wes craven gives us nothing to fear in the way of lost entertainment . \\nin fact , at the risk of sounding sacrilegious to all the adorning fans of scream , i would say that scream 2 might even be the better film ! \\nsidney prescott ( neve campbell ) , the sinuous heroine who survived a series of murders in woodsboro , ca in the original scream , is now two years older and off to college , majoring in theater . \\nmeanwhile , tv journalist gale weathers ( courtney cox ) , who covered the murders in the first film , has since written a book about the dreadful events ; a book titled \" stab \" , which has been developed into a major motion picture . \\nas scream 2 opens , a crowd of overzealous teenagers are piling into a crowded movie theater for the premiere of \" stab \" , and before long , a young couple are butchered to death , unnoticed in the midst of hysteria . \\nthis marks the beginning of a new murder spree as an unknown \" copycat \" sets out to repeat what\\'s been done . \\n . \\n . \\nand finish what hasn\\'t ! \\nof course the killer is just as obsessed with movies as the killer in the first film , and yes , movies play a huge role in the bizarre psychological outlook the murderer holds as he/she goes about slaying an assortment of gorgeous twenty year olds , but this * is * a sequel , and without deviating from the original groundwork we are still given a fresh outlook on horror movies . \\nthis is in large part due to williamson\\'s deliciously written script , which will easily leave you satisfied . \\nas much as the film condemns the use of cliches , it is riddled with them , but it is done so effectively , and with skillful direction by craven , that you\\'re not bound to complain . \\ni will note , however , that the \" whodunit ? \" \\ndid wind up being the first person i suspected , but believe me , i kept changing my mind as i tried to stay one ahead of the movie . \\nall the actors outdo themselves here . \\nwe\\'re not talking oscar performances , but cambell , cox , david arquette as dewey riley , and jamie kennedy as randy all give surprisingly satisfying performances that go beyond their last outing . \\nthe characters remain true to their roots , and yet show a clear sign of development over the last two years . \\nwe can see how the events in the first film has affected them , but we don\\'t lose any of the luster that made them such a delight to watch in the first place . \\nthe nice thing about scream 2 is that it doesn\\'t seem off-kilter from it\\'s predecessor . \\nit\\'s a natural , smooth , and believable ( as far as horror films go ) transition from film to film . \\nwe skip two years , but there doesn\\'t seem to be any holes or shortcuts taken in connecting the two flicks . \\nit flows so well that you feel more like you\\'re reading chapter two of a book ( long chapters , eh ? ) \\nthan just revitalizing a cast of familiar faces . \\nwhile main characters are usually the only connection in sequels , scream 2\\'s entire plot structure correlates * completely * with the first , making for immediate fondness and absorption . \\nas i said before , scream 2 easily lives up to , if not surpassing , it\\'s precursor . \\nthe only reason scream will likely be hailed above scream 2 is because it was the first . \\nthis doesn\\'t mean that it overcasts the unique , whimsical humor or overall caliber of it\\'s sequel , it just means that scream will forever be known as the movie that mocked it\\'s own while maintaining it\\'s sought-after qualities . \\nif ever a film followed it\\'s original so well , it would be scream 2 , and it makes this a definite must-see for all those unbridled scream fans out there . \\nscream 2 fits snugly alongside scream , and will hopefully receive as many high remarks . \\nit would top off the series quite well , if it weren\\'t for the fact that two movies don\\'t really make a series . \\nit\\'s unlikely to assume that a scream 3 won\\'t appear in the next few years , but if they do decide to turn this into an undeniably acclaimed horror-trilogy , let\\'s hope they can keep up the fantastic work . \\nlike they say , don\\'t mess with perfection . \\n . \\n . \\nbut when a money-making smash-hit is almost guaranteed , who\\'s gonna listen ? \\n',\n",

\\nwhat about his brother who got him involved in the game in the first place ? \\ndouglas portrays this aspect of his character extremely well , and gives one of his best performances ( even better than his \" falling down \" persona ) . \\nthe supporting cast is essential in this film , and casting was critical . \\nsean penn is always good , and he gives yet another credible performance as douglas\\' brother . \\ndeborah kara unger ( from \" crash \" ) is the waitress he bumps into , and her performance is extremely good . \\nin fact , she almost steals the film from douglas . \\njames rebhorn portrays his character very well , and adds some confusion and desparation to douglas\\' predicament . \\nanother good performance comes from armin mueller-stahl ( from \" shine \" ) as the book editor . \\nbut considering that douglas is in every single scene of the game , he not only commands this cast , but makes this distant and lonely character come to colorful life . \\nthe game is rated r for language , violence , some gore , and some nudity and drugs . \\nwhat is essential for this film to work is the writing . \\njohn brancato and michael ferris have woven a confusing and compelling screenplay with witty dialogue , and some very funny moments . \\nthis screenplay will probably get an oscar nomination for best original screenplay because it does almost exactly the same thing the usual suspects\\' did . \\nhowever , the visuals of the game are enough to make the viewer enjoy the vexing plot . \\nand if you can get yourself to believe everything occuring on the screen , you will be thoroughly entertained by one of this year\\'s best films . \\n',\n",

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \\nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\\'t ) . \\nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \\nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \\nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \\nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\\'s a catch -- he\\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\\'s now infected with alien dna . \\npatrick\\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \\nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\\'s primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \\nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \\nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \\nmr . brancato\\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \\nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \\nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \\nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \\nand she\\'s not even empathic ! \\nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he\\'s going to rape her . \" \\nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \\nthere\\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he\\'s in aisle 1 ! \" \\ninforms eve ) . \\nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \\nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \\nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\\'s brain ? \\nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \\nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \\nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\\'s being foisted upon the public . \\nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \\nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \\nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \\nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she\\'s so empowered . \" \\na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\\'s * what i call empowerment . \\n',\n",
       " b'many people will not find much to like in what dreams may come , the new film by visionary director vincent ward . \\nmost will come to see the computer animated landscapes and vibrant colors . \\nbut little do they know ( as i so plainly found out ) that this has quite a complex story to tell . \\nwalking out of the theater , i could see the audience\\'s disgust . . . \\none member even had to be awakened after the film ended . \\ndon\\'t believe the previews that you see . . . \\nthis is definitely not a film for everyone . \\nthis is quite possibly one of the most adult-oriented films to come out in recent years . \\nkids will get bored with the slow plotting and the complex storyline . \\nthe plot is just as fluid as the heaven that ward presents to us . \\nit goes back and forth in time , as if it has no boundaries . \\nthink of the film city of angels . \\nnow add a more complex screenplay and a more unique vision . \\nboth films deal with the afterlife , but i doubt what dreams may come will do well at the box office . \\ncosting around $85 million to make , the film would have to do extremely well in order to make it\\'s money back . \\nbut due to it\\'s story , i doubt it will . \\nfor everyone who thought titanic\\'s story was too simple and cliche , here is proof that if james cameron had written a more complex screenplay , it may not have done nearly as well . \\nbut don\\'t get me wrong . . . \\ni hope the film does do well . \\nit\\'s a vision of pure visceral enjoyment that hardly ever gets put to the screen . \\ni doubt most of us could have thought of this place , even in our own mind . \\nwhat dreams may come is the second best film of the year when it comes to visuals . \\nthe only film that surpasses it is dark city . \\nfull of rich , shocking colors , we get to see a heaven that most of us would probably die to get to . \\nbut don\\'t do that , because you\\'ll end up going to hell . \\nwhat dreams may come begins with two boats colliding on a lake . \\nchris \" christy \" nielsen ( robin williams ) is startled by the sudden jolt , but is even more startled by the beauty of the woman in the other boat . \\nannie ( annabella sciorra ) spies chris , as well , and both eventually bond and get married . \\nannie is an artist , whose paintings are colorful , lush , and surrealistic . \\nchris is a doctor and loves annie more than life itself . \\nthey also have two children , marie ( jessica brooks ) and ian ( josh paddock ) . \\nbut one day , the two children are killed in a car crash , and it almost destroys annie . \\nshe tries to commit suicide , but fails , and is then put in an institution . \\nchris copes with the problem by realizing they aren\\'t around anymore , and nothing will change that . \\njust as annie gets her life back in order , chris is killed while trying to save the life of a car crash victim . \\nchris goes to heaven , or his version of heaven , rather . \\nguided by albert ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , chris explores his new surroundings with pure delight and joy . \\nthat is , until he realizes how miserable he is without annie . \\nprior to heaven , he would try to comfort annie , but the more he was around , the more pain she felt . \\nchris decides to leave her alone . \\nlittle does he realize what will happen next . \\ni\\'m not about to say , because the plot point is crucial to the rest of the story ( many critics , however , give it away ) . \\ncertainly , chris dying is crucial to the plot , but they tell you that he dies in the previews . \\nstory is not necessarily important for this movie to work , because it deals with the afterlife . \\nhowever , strangely , virtually nothing is heard of god or the devil . \\na couple of comments here and there , but the story maintains its focus on chris and his search for the love of his life . \\n \" we\\'re soul mates ! \" \\nchris exclaims . \\nheaven , in movies , is almost always depicted as a glowing city of white , purity , and love . \\nusually , it also looks like it rests among the clouds . \\nbut what dreams may come goes a different route . \\nit shows us a heaven that most of us have never seen before . \\nchris\\' heaven is his memories brought to life . \\nhis thoughts can make anything real , and he makes the paintings annie drew become his heaven . \\n \" i\\'ve never seen anyone use real paint before , \" albert says . \\nequally good as the depictions of hell which cast away the normal stereotypes of fire and brimstone . \\ninstead , it\\'s a state of being . \\nin one gloriously horrific scene , chris and his \" tracker \" ( max von sydow ) arrive at a sea of faces . \\nthousands of heads are stuck above ground , their bodies somewhere else . \\nmostly dead silent , some quips are made , almost as if to lighten the mood . \\nit\\'s truly a frightening sequence . \\nproduction designer eugenio zanetti is definitely going to be up for an oscar nomination . \\nusing state of the art computer technology , worlds are created for exploration . \\nsometimes , some scenes play out as if they are only there for the visual impact . \\nit\\'s not necessary to be there , but we appreciate seeing it . \\ncostume designer yvonne blake ( who also appears in the film ) has done an incredible job providing some interesting and colorful costumes . \\ncinematographer eduardo serra , whose work was last seen in the luscious wings of the dove , has a difficult job , as most cinematographers do working with special effects . \\nbut serra\\'s entire universe is a computer generated image , and he does a masterful job . \\nwriter ron bass , adapting from the novel by richard matheson , provides a very fluid screenplay with no real set plot . \\nthe story is extremely vague in its details , allowing viewers to think for themselves about the meaning . \\nand director vincent ward puts it all together into his final vision . \\nwhat dreams may come is a good example of german expressionism which may just turn off a good portion of the audience . \\nyour average movie goer more than likely isn\\'t used to expressionistic techniques . \\nthe film will also definitely draw attention from religious people , but they shouldn\\'t take it too far . \\nit is , after all , just a movie . \\nrobin williams has continuously impressed with his dramatic performances , while his comedic roles have been suffering . \\nhis comedy is perfection when he makes up his own stuff , but when is confined by a screenplay , he isn\\'t quite as effective . \\nbut drama is really his strong point , and you can see that here . \\nit\\'s doubtful he\\'ll get another oscar nomination , but i wouldn\\'t really mind if he did . \\nthe real surprise here is annabella sciorra who impressed last year with cop land . \\nthis may be her breakout role and may garner her some much needed attention . \\nit\\'s also quite possible that she could get an oscar nomination . \\nhowever , the academy doesn\\'t like to award performances for these types of films . \\ncuba gooding , jr . has been better , but he\\'s certainly not distracting . \\nmax von sydow is underused , as are jessica brooks and josh paddock . \\na treat for some movie goers is to see werner herzog appear ( if they even recognize him ) as chris\\' father lost in the sea of faces . \\nit\\'s not hard to see why herzog would be attracted to this film , considering he thinks that audiences are starving for great images . \\noverall , it\\'s williams and sciorra\\'s film . \\nwhat dreams may come is rated pg-13 for thematic elements involving death , some disturbing images , language , and some partial nudity . \\nthe film is definitely aimed at a more adult audience . \\nsome will find the plot distracting . \\nsome will find the visuals absolutely glorious . \\nand some will find both . \\nthe only real problem with the film , that i could see , was that it slows down considerably during the midsection , just after we have been immersed in the visuals and before the search for annie begins . \\nby the way , some controversy even surrounded the title , which was mistaken for a sexual term ( \" what \" becomes \" wet \" and you should understand ) . \\nin actuality , the title is from a soliloquy in hamlet . \\njust thought i should let you know . \\n',\n",

\\nshould this guy be forced to do something he doesn\\'t want to do ? \\nthis appears to be one of the million questions in this film , which is jam-packed with greatness , but does not have the totally brilliant whole it should . \\ni\\'m not saying \" good will hunting \" is a bad film at all . \\nit\\'s a very enjoyable film with tons of great moments , and lots of great things about it . \\nthe acting is amazing , with two oscar-nomination-worthy performances from damon and williams , who have amazing chemistry together . \\nwe also get some great support from stellan skarsg ? rd ( great name ) , ben affleck , and from minnie driver , who plays will\\'s love interest , skylar . \\nthere are tons of individual moments that i adored . \\ni loved all the comedy in the film , especially a scene where damon proves a schmuck out of a college student who is quoting a historian to impress some chicks , his various attempts at therapy , and of course , my favorite scene in the entire film , the one where he delivers a long , exstensive rant to some nsa agents about the downside of working for them . \\ni liked the relationship between some of the people , like will and skylar , will and sean , sean and lambeau , and will and his friends . \\nthere are scenes between them which are just amazing to watch . \\nand there are even moments in the film which are so honest in their portrayal , that i felt rightfully uncomfortable . \\nlike the break-up scene between will and skylar , will and sean\\'s first meeting , a bar scene between sean and lambeau , and a scene where sean tells in detail how he doesn\\'t regret meeting his first wife , who would later suffer a slow , painful death , and leave him lonely and slightly bitter . \\nhowever , the main flaw of the film is there\\'s too much of everything , and not enough of it either . \\nthe film tries for deeper relations between the characters , but they\\'re sometimes either overwritten or underwritten . \\ntake for example the relationship between sean and will : the film gets an interesting father/son as well as doctor/patient relationship going with out any problems , but when it tries to show them as equals , it falls on its face . \\nwe hear how they went to the same town , and there are even scenes where the film shows how hypocritical both of them are at times . \\nbut this never takes off like the other parts of their relationship do . \\nalso , will\\'s relationship with his best friend , chuckie ( affleck ) , has a nice climax , but not enough rising action . \\nwe see them joking around , but when chuckie arrives at a decision between the two of them , it seems more like a superficial reasoning than a more selected one . \\ntheir relationship never goes beyond \" just best friends , \" and his decision just seems to be a generalization of any two best friends instead of something more . . . human . \\nmaybe it was just me . \\nand it also goes for a parallelism with the relationship between sean and lambeau , but that , again , is underwritten . \\nand , of course , as in most films like this , the girl/boy relationship is pretty underwritten . \\nwe never understand what they see in each other , so when skylar confesses that she loves him , it seems more like it\\'s there for plot details that anything else . \\nminnie driver is interesting , though , and breathes life into her character . \\nthe writing is a bit at fault here , but what makes all this worthwhile is the little moments in the film where it acheives true awesomeness . \\nsure , it feels overstuffed , but it\\'s extremely enjoyable . \\nthe dialogue that affleck and damon have written is amazingly fresh , and seems extremely human . \\ni think that they should get a nomination for their script chiefly because of the dialogue , which is amazing . \\nwhile this is probably director gus van sant\\'s most conservative film ( you\\'d hardly know it\\'s the same director of \" to die for , \" the only van sant film i\\'ve seen , really ) , it\\'s still a pretty remarkable film , albeit a tad overrated ( what\\'s this \" best picture \" deal ?

       " b\"an american werewolf in london is john landis' groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england . \\nthe groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects . \\nmore specifically , the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character . \\neven twenty years after its release , that part of the movie is still impressive . \\nalthough , i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive . \\nthe rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure . \\nif it weren't for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 . \\nand with good reason -- the acting isn't great and neither is the writing . \\nwell ok , we don't actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film . \\nbut one other important element is lacking here too -- it isn't scary . \\nwith no exception , you know what is going to happen before it happens . \\nyou don't even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint . \\ni will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen . \\nbut john , it just wasn't scary . \\ni didn't know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it , but it didn't work for me . \\nactually , it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films . \\nbut the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me . \\nit's never a good sign that you don't realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material . \\ncall me crazy , but you shouldn't have to do research on a movie to enjoy it . \\ni'm not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much , since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up . \\nwerewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) . \\nboy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy . \\nincluding , and i must admit this is a very nice touch , visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital . \\nthe neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse . \\ni know it sounds strange , but it actually works . \\nthe scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie . \\nas i said , probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects . \\nwhile they are still impressive today , they aren't impressive enough , or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film . \\nand since they are more or less the highlight of the film , there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch . \\nactually , the 1998 sequel , an american werewolf in paris , is more entertaining since it doesn't take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way . \\n\",\n",
       " b'there\\'s more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \\nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \\nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \\nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \\nthe \" quilting bee \" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma\\'s husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna\\'s daughter . \\nthe project they\\'re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy\\'s granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \\nshe\\'s spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it\\'s better to marry a friend or a lover . \\none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \\nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \\nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script\\'s weaknesses . \\nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \\nthere are probably too many characters . \\nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \\nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \\nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna\\'s life , marianna\\'s soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend\\'s husband . \\nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn\\'s story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \\nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \\nthe stories are all well-told , but it\\'s difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \\nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \\nthere isn\\'t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \\nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn\\'t \" do much \" for me . \\non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \\nfinn\\'s segment is by far the most compelling , because she\\'s the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else\\'s experiences . \\nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \\nif there\\'s a disappointment here , it\\'s that the script doesn\\'t have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \\n',\n",
       " b'in 1998 , director brett ratner and his stars , jackie chan and chris tucker , breathed new life into the buddy-action film genre with the cross-cultural \" rush hour \" - to the tune of about $250 million . \\nyou don\\'t mess with success , so the team is back again , and better , in \" rush hour 2 . \" \\nthe combo of the terrific physical talents of chan and the non-stop motor mouth of tucker made for an ethnically unusual duet in \" rush hour \" that played well to audiences around the world . \\nthe formula worked so well , in fact , that the sequel was inevitable . \\ni\\'m never thrilled with the idea of a follow-up to a successful original since they rarely meet the previously set expectations . \\nsurprisingly , \" rush hour 2 \" wastes no time getting down to business and turns out to be better than the flick that spawned it . \\nthe script , by jeff nathanson ( utilizing the characters developed by ross lamanna in the first film ) , wastes no time getting to the point right from the start . \\nterrorists have bombed the us embassy in hong kong , killing two american translators , and chief inspector lee ( jackie chan ) is handed the job of solving the crime . \\nconcurrently , his friend james carter ( chris tucker ) arrives on the island for some much needed r&r and expects his friend to spend some time and show him the sights . \\ninstead , lee drags carter into the case and the duo get involved in stopping a conspiracy to counterfeit hundreds of million of us dollars . \\nthe makers of \" rush hour 2 \" are working at a distinct advantage over the original . \\nwe , the viewer , are familiar with the two lead characters and the already-existing chemistry that chan and tucker developed so well the first time around . \\nthat chemistry was a high point ( and probably the saving point ) before and , now , the pair wears their friendship like a comfortable suit . \\nlittle time is wasted in getting to know the key players so the screenplay capitalizes on those things we liked best in \" rush hour . \" \\nfirst and foremost to me , in \" rh2 , \" is the immense pleasure in watching jackie chan\\'s artistry in fight choreography . \\nthe 47-year old martial arts master has a renowned reputation for doing all of his own stunt work and , here , he does not disappoint . \\nchan\\'s use of props when battling bad guys continues as he pulverizes his opponents with whatever item comes to hand , such as a trash bucket . \\nhis moves look every bit as good as they ever did as he fights four or five nemesis at once on bamboo scaffolding , on the tail end of a yacht , in a hong kong massage parlor and , for the finale , in a las vegas casino . \\nlike harold lloyd or buster keaton , chan takes pride in putting his physical self on the line in pursuit of his artistry and is a joy to watch . \\nchris tucker reprises his role as the motor mouthed la cop , carter , who teams , again , with lee to put down the bad guys . \\nwhen he is unceremoniously pulled from his vacation to help his colleague and friend with the big case , he still looks to have some fun . \\nwhen lee goes into a karaoke bar , the lair of chief bad guy ricky tan ( john lone ) and his hoods , carter takes the spotlight on stage with a credible michael jackson riff . \\nthe comedian made the move from the improv stage to the big screen and , with jackie chan , has a franchise to hang his coat on to pay the bills . \\nthe combo of chan\\'s flying feet and fists with tucker\\'s fast mouth make a duet more endearing than riggs and murtaugh in the \" lethal weapon \" films . \\nthe supporting cast is here to move things along efficiently . \\njohn lone , as ricky tan , is a suave villain who is the real power behind the throne of american bigwig steven reign ( alan king in a walk through performance ) . \\nlone doesn\\'t chew scenery or make pronouncements to \" get lee and carter , \" but gives the chief bad guy elegance . \\nzhang zi-yi ( \" crouching tiger , hidden dragon \" ) continues to display her martial arts skills as ricky\\'s taciturn henchlady , hu li , who carries on an ongoing battle with carter . \\n ( carter has a problem , through most of the film , with hitting a woman , but this falls aside with their eventual one-on-one melee at the conclusion . ) \\nroselyn sanchez is knockdown gorgeous ( and resembles sandra bullock ) as undercover agent isabella molina - she doesn\\'t add much to the equation but is terrific to watch . \\ndirector ratner and the original \" rush hour \" production team have assembled a crew of skilled craftsmen to work behind the camera . \\ncinematographer matthew f . leonetti has had a long career of shooting action flicks and gives \" rh2 \" the fluid camera movement the genre film needs . \\nproduction design by terrence marsh spans continents and gives the right look , whether it is in a hong kong karaoke bar or a high stakes las vegas casino . \\nthe rest of the techs are of the same high quality . \\ni\\'m surprised to even say that \" rush hour 2 \" is the most entertaining of the summer blockbuster movies . \\nit takes the best of the first film and kicks jurassic dino butt in its fun , frolic and fast pace and is the best mainstream thing out , so far , this summer . \\ni give it a b . \\n',\n",
       " b'in 1989 , director edward zwick began his career with the powerful civil war drama , \" glory , \" but since then , he has made continuous disappointments , to me at least , with 1994\\'s \" legends of the fall , \" and 1996\\'s \" courage under fire . \" \\nthose two films weren\\'t bad , just not very good , but with zwick\\'s latest film , \" the siege , \" he has finally made one . \\n \" the siege , \" is a modern-day action-thriller that focuses on terrorism that is sweeping through new york city . \\ninvestigating the matter is fbi agents anthony hubbard ( denzel washington ) and frank haddad ( tony shalhoub ) , who are first hit by the ordeal when a city bus explodes with several innocent people on it . \\nlater , a bomb goes off in a broadway theater , killing even more . \\nthey soon meet cia operative elise kraft ( annette bening ) , who may very well hold the key to the identity of the arab terrorist . \\nthere are some movies that simply don\\'t need to be made , and , \" the siege \" may very well be one of them . \\noh , sure , zwick thinks he is making a \" meaningful \" action film , since he has added lots of exposition scenes in which the audience is basically lectured on the horrors of terrorism , but what he really has made is actually no more substantial than , say , \" die hard , \" which also starred bruce willis . \\nthis time , willis is horribly wasted as a general of the u . s . army , who puts a state of martial law over nyc during the climax . \\nwhatever points , \" the siege , \" earnestly tried to make , were obviously lost in the translation from page to screen , or maybe , zwick never really had anything serious to say in the first place . \\nthe role of the arab community is offensively stereotypical , just as women were in the recent , \" john caprenter\\'s vampires , \" by placing them all in the category of \" bad guys . \" \\n \" the siege , \" contains three fine actors---washington , bening , and shalhoub---but washington is stuck with a character that contains not an ounce of even remote development . \\nbening has slightly more to do , and has an intriguing character to work with , while shalhoub pretty much steals the show , even though , again , he has no real character . \\nby the climax of , \" the siege , \" with washington giving a sermon to willis on the so-called \" message \" of the story , i felt like i had wandered into a sequel to , \" on deadly ground , \" in which steven seagal gave a 10-minute speech at the end about preserving the environment . \\n \" the siege \" is constantly heavy-handed , not entertaining or insightful , and just goes to prove that not even the best actors can save a film that lacks a satisfactory screenplay . \\n',\n",
       " b'with the success of the surprise hit alien , directed by ridley scott , a sequel was inevitable . \\nin fact , after watching the first film , a sequel was wanted , particularly by this reviewer . \\nhanding over the director\\'s chair to recent box office gem james cameron , who had only made two films previous to this one ( pirahna ii , a surprisingly dull film , and terminator , making cameron a household name ) , the alien series got a face-lift of immense proportions . \\ninstead of being a suspense/science fiction film , cameron alters the series and changing it into an action picture . \\nwhat results is one of the most terrifying films ever created . \\na film like aliens comes along only once in a while , and when it does , audiences are usually unprepared for it . \\ni never saw this movie in theaters , but i wish i could have . \\nthe terror and fright must have been unimaginable , most likely with audiences members literally shrieking in fear . \\naliens is an action film unlike any i have ever seen . \\nwith a science fiction plot , cameron gives aliens added testosterone , pumping up the action and fire power from the original film . \\nin fact , aliens is one of those few sequels which tops the original . \\nperhaps what makes the alien series so impressive is the hero--or heroine , as the case may be . \\nnever have we had a more sympathetic hero in an action film , and never have i seen such an impressive acting job done by the main character . \\nsigourney weaver is possibly the only actress who could play this character and make her realistic enough for us to care about . \\nplacing a woman in these situations would sometimes seem unusual , but because of weaver\\'s presence , a woman is the only suitable hero . \\naliens begins 57 years after alien ended . \\nlieutenant ellen ripley ( weaver ) is discovered in hypersleep on the nostromo and is awakened . \\nshe explains how she is the only survivor of her past encounter with the aliens , but \" the company \" is doubtful . \\nthey explain that a colony of families is flourishing on the same planet from which she just left . \\ndespite stern warnings from ripley , the company remains rigid and won\\'t call the families back . \\nhowever , when the company loses contact with the colony , ripley\\'s story seems much more feasible . \\none of the company\\'s directors , carter burke ( paul reiser ) , wants to gather a team to travel to the planet . \\nthis team includes a buff private vasquez ( jenette goldstein ) , a questionable corporal hicks ( michael biehn ) , and a loyal android bishop ( lance henriksen ) . \\nburke tags along with ripley as they fly to the planet in order to locate the members of the colony . \\narriving on the planet , the team finds most of the human life extinguished in a cocoon-type environment . \\nthe only survivor is 12 year old rebecca \" newt \" jorden ( carrie henn ) . \\nripley finds this a chance to be the mother she never had the opportunity to become , and she becomes newt\\'s surrogate mother . \\nripley and newt are the only ones who knows what has happened , and soon , all hell breaks loose . \\naliens not only multiplies the thrills and suspense from scott\\'s version , it also multiplies the number of aliens in general . \\nalien focused on one alien in particular which systematically killed each crew member , except ripley , who managed to jettison the alien out of the nostromo . \\naliens focuses on an entire race of these aliens , and as a result , the chills are incredibly heightened . \\nthen again , this is james cameron , the guy who has given us true lies and terminator 2 : judgment day . \\nhe is the best action director out there ( topping renny harlin , who directed cliffhanger ) , and only he could create something as terrifying as this film . \\nit seems that every alien film seems to have some memorable scene or scenes , and aliens has the motherload . \\nwith perhaps one of the most astonishing endings ever created for an action film , aliens climax never seems to hit until the viewer is nearly pushed to extreme exhaustion . \\ni can\\'t recall another film ever to sustain this level of intensity throughout , never dropping for a moment . \\njust when you think the movie is over , something else will occur , and it starts right back up again . \\nwith a seemingly endless conclusion , aliens ends with one of the greatest moments in film history . \\nthis scene is usually the one remembered most from the film , as lieutenant ripley steps into one of the lifting machines to fight the alien queen . \\nusing flawless special effects , the climax is exhausting , leaving any audience member drained from extreme anxiety . \\nof course , for a film of this genre to work properly , the technical aspects must be realistic enough for us to believe what we see . \\naliens is completely realistic , even a decade after its initial release . \\nthe special effects are wonderfully seamless , with a terrifying alien to go with them . \\none of the most overlooked aspects of this film is the music , composed by cameron-regular james horner . \\nhorner has created a terrific score , receiving an oscar nomination for his work . \\nnot only that , horner has also created one of the best scores for any action film , or science fiction film ever ( and that includes 2001 : a space odyssey , which was mainly a compilation of well-known composers ) . \\nin fact , the climax music is also some of the most recognized of film music . \\nthe production design is incredible , which also happened to snag a nomination from the academy . \\ndark corridors lit by red lights are very impressive , but more impressive is the amount of terror which arises from well-lit locations . \\nnormally a film will be very dark in order to scare a viewer ; aliens uses lights to scare the viewer . \\nthen , of course , is the cinematography , which uses point of view shots , along with video feeds in order to build suspense . \\nsome of the scariest scenes involve the perspective of ripley . \\nsurprisingly , the acting is not only above average for this genre , but some of the best . \\nsigourney weaver received an oscar nomination for her portrayal of ripley , incorporating the right amount of sympathy into her hard-edged persona . \\nweaver soars above the rest in this film , but she is supposed to . \\ncarrie henn gives an above average performance for a child , developing a three-dimensional character from her quiet attitude . \\nlance henriksen is terrific as bishop , showing that androids don\\'t always have to be flat characters . \\njenette goldstein shows a fair amount of enthusiasm with her role , and steals several scenes of her own ( though her personality becomes slightly annoying when she isn\\'t fighting ) . \\nmichael biehn gives a very nice performance in the most obligatory role of the film . \\nhowever , biehn does a good job , making it seem original again . \\npaul reiser may seem like an odd choice to play the sleazy corporate director , but reiser manages to pull it off quite well ( however , i still see him as paul on tv\\'s \" mad about you \" ) . \\na very good cast ( which also includes bill paxton and william hope ) highlights this action film , making it stand out from others . \\naliens is rightfully rated r for violence , gore , language , and terror . \\naliens is sort of the redefining moment of the science fiction genre , as alien was more of a suspense/horror film . \\naliens pumps up the stakes , and cameron directs it with professional quality . \\ncameron certainly knows how to make a good action film , but here he proves how he can create some truly horrific moments on screen . \\ntechnically astonishing , aliens\\' only flaw is small characters who are only there to get killed . \\naside from this , you probably won\\'t experience anything like aliens for quite a while . \\n',\n",

       " b'weighed down by tired plot lines and spielberg\\'s reliance on formulas , _saving private ryan_ is a mediocre film which nods in the direction of realism before descending into an abyss of cliches . \\nthere ought to be a law against steven spielberg making movies about truly serious topics . \\nspielberg\\'s greatest strength as a director is the polished , formulaic way in which every aspect of the film falls carefully into place to make a perfect story . \\nbut for a topic of such weight as combat in the second world war ( or the holocaust ) this technique backfires , for it creates coherent , comprehensible and redemptive narratives out of events whose size , complexity and evil are utterly beyond the reach of human ken . \\nin this way spielberg trivializes the awesome evil of the stories he films . \\n_saving private ryan_ tells the story of eight men who have been detailed on a \" pr mission \" to pull a young man , ryan ( whose three other brothers were just killed in fighting elsewhere ) out of combat on the normandy front just after d-day . \\nryan is a paratrooper who dropped behind enemy lines the night before the landings and became separated from his fellow soldiers . \\nthe search for him takes the eight soldiers across the hellish terrain of world war ii combat in france . \\nthere\\'s no denying spielberg came within shouting distance of making a great war movie . \\nthe equipment , uniforms and weapons are superbly done . \\nthe opening sequence , in which captain miller ( tom hanks ) leads his men onto omaha beach , is quite possibly the closest anyone has come to actually capturing the unendurably savage intensity of modern infantry combat . \\nanother pleasing aspect of the film is spielberg\\'s brave depiction of scenes largely unknown to american audiences , such as the shooting of prisoners by allied soldiers , the banality of death in combat , the routine foul-ups in the execution of the war , and the cynicism of the troops . \\nthe technical side of the film is peerless , as always . \\nthe camera work is magnificent , the pacing perfect , the sets convincing , the directing without flaw . \\nhanks will no doubt be nominated for an oscar for his performance , which was utterly convincing , and the supporting cast was excellent , though ted danson seems a mite out of place as a paratroop colonel . \\nyet the attempt at a realistic depiction of combat falls flat on its face because realism is not something which can be represented by single instances or events . \\nit has to thoroughly permeate the context at every level of the film , or the story fails to convince . \\nthroughout the movie spielberg repeatedly showed only single examples of the grotesque wounds produced by modern mechanized devices ( exception : men are shown burning to death with relative frequency ) . \\nfor example , we see only one man with guts spilled out on the ground . \\nhere and there men lose limbs ; in one scene miller is pulling a man to safety , there\\'s an explosion , and miller looks back to see he is only pulling half a man . \\nbut the rest of the corpses are remarkably intact . \\nthere are no shoes with only feet in them , no limbs scattered everywhere , no torsos without limbs , no charred corpses , and most importantly , all corpses have heads ( in fairness there are a smattering of wicked head wounds ) . \\nthe relentless dehumanization of the war , in which even corpses failed to retain any indentity , is soft-pedaled in the film . \\nultimately , _saving private ryan_ bows to both hollywood convention and the unwritten rules of wartime photography in its portrayal of wounds and death in war . \\nrather than saying _saving private ryan_ is \" realistic , \" it would be better to describe it as \" having realistic moments . \" \\nanother aspect of the \" hollywoodization \" of the war is the lack of realistic dialogue and in particular , the lack of swearing . \\nanyone familiar with the literature on the behavior of the men during the war , such as fussell\\'s superb _wartime : understanding and behavior in the second world war_ ( which has an extensive discussion on swearing ) , knows that the troops swore fluently and without letup . \\n \" who is this private ryan that we have to die for him ? \" \\nasks one infantrymen in the group of eight . \\nrendered in wartime demotic , that should have been expressed as \" who is this little pecker that we have to get our dicks shot off for him ? \" \\nor some variant thereof . \\nconversations should have been literally sprinkled with the \" f \" word , and largely about ( the search for ) food and sex . \\nthis is all the more inexplicable because the movie already had an \" r \" rating due to violence , so swearing could not possibly have been eliminated to make it a family film . \\nhowever , the most troubling aspect of the film is the spielbergization of the topic . \\nthe most intense hell humans have ever created for themselves is not emotionally wrenching enough for steven spielberg . \\nhe cannot just cede control to the material ; he has to be bigger than it . \\nas if afraid to let the viewer find their own ( perhaps unsettled and not entirely clear ) emotional foothold in the material , spielberg has to package it in hallmark moments to give the war a meaning and coherence it never had : the opening and closing scenes of ryan and his family in the war cemetary ( reminscent of the closing scene from _schindler\\'s list ) , the saccharine exchange between ryan and his wife at the close ( every bit as bad as schindler\\'s monologue about how his car , tiepin or ring could have saved another jew ) , quotes from abraham lincoln and emerson , captain miller\\'s last words to private ryan , and an unbelievable storyline in which a prisoner whom they free earlier in the movie comes back to kill the captain . \\nthat particular subplot is so hokey , so predictable , it nigh on ruins the film . \\nnowhere in the film is there a resolute depiction of the meaninglessness , stupidity and waste which characterized the experience of war to the men who actually fought in combat ( imagine if miller had been killed by friendly fire or collateral damage ) . \\nbecause of its failure to mine deeply into the terrible realities of world war ii , _saving private ryan_ can only pan for small truths in the shallows . \\n . \\n',\n",

       " b'in 1994 , an insider\\'s look at a scandal-ridden run for the democratic presidential nomination ( closely based on clinton\\'s 1992 campaign ) was written anonymously ( former newsweek writer joe klein later claimed true authorship ) . \\nnow , the book , primary colors , has been made into a movie , directed by mike nichols , and , in light of recent presidential scandals , seems to be more relevant than ever . \\nbut the film is more than a diatribe against , or a paean in praise of , the president . \\nit is a fascinating look at the political machinery , and the ethical quagmire , that surround modern politics . \\njack stanton ( john travolta ) is the governor of a small southern state running for the democratic presidential nomination . \\nhe is charismatic , but has several flaws which threaten to doom his campaign , and strains his relationship with his wife , susan ( emma thompson ) . \\nthe film is told from the point of view of henry burton ( adrian lester ) , grandson of a civil rights leader , who is swept away by stanton\\'s ideals and helps to organize the campaign . \\nhe joins political strategist richard jemmons ( billy bob thornton , looking an awful lot like james carville ) , and campaign advisor daisy green ( maura tierney ) . \\ngovernor stanton\\'s past repeatedly pops up to haunt him , a fact that his chief rival , lawrence harris ( kevin cooney ) , consistently uses to his advantage . \\nto help clean up the stanton campaign , jack and susan bring in an old friend , libby \" the dustbuster \" holden ( kathy bates ) . \\nthe acting throughout primary colors is superb . \\nit would be worth seeing the movie for bates\\' wild performance alone . \\nshe enlivens the atmosphere with energy in a truly boisterous performance . \\ntravolta does a fair clinton impersonation as governor stanton , although his accent does stray a little . \\nemma thompson delivers a strong performance as his suffering wife who can\\'t let anything show that might hurt the presidential run . \\nthe problem with political movies is that they tend to alienate over half of their audience by promoting one side or the other , or else the movie is vague to the point of boredom . \\nprimary colors treads lightly on this issue . \\nthough stanton is clearly portrayed as a democrat , and there are a few minor barbs thrown in the way of republicans , the movie touches on few actual political issues . \\nin fact , most of the \" bad guys \" are fellow democrats on the same road to the white house . \\nrather than issues , the film is primarily concerned about scandals and spin control . \\nalthough the film strays into some obviously non-clinton territory , it is difficult to completely separate it from reality ( particularly when certain scenes seem to highlight the president\\'s current troubles ) . \\nprimary colors\\' chief problem is its length . \\nit runs about 15 minutes too long . \\nthere are some scenes which could have easily been cut . \\nfor example , midway through the film , the candidate gives a speech to an assembly of laid off machinists . \\nthe scene\\'s only apparent purpose is to establish stanton\\'s character , which has already been done in similar scenes earlier in the film . \\nthe extra length isn\\'t long enough nor tiring enough to be annoying , but it mars an otherwise excellent film . \\nrepublicans , democrats , and political agnostics should all be able to find something to like in primary colors . \\nit\\'s a funny , and at some times shocking , look at the modern political process . \\n',\n",
       " b'the computer-animated comedy \" shrek \" is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups . \\nfor children , it offers imaginative visuals , appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces , loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances , apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) . \\nfor adults , it\\'s a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids . \\nall in all , \" shrek \" is a snappy ride , although there are a couple of points i found disturbing . \\nbut first the basics . \\nbased very loosely on a 1990 children\\'s story , \" shrek \" follows several momentous days in the life of the title character , a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using . \\nshrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp , until a local nobleman disturbs his peace . \\npetty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the \" awk \" in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides . \\nhe proceeds to turn the ogre\\'s yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle . \\nas a result , shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice , pinocchio , the big bad wolf , the seven dwarfs , and the three bears , to name but a few . \\nan enraged shrek storms to the castle , only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain . \\nlord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from \" snow white \" has shown him the way . \\nall he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife . \\nthe mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of \" the dating game \" ( when snow white is shown , the cheeky announcer purrs , \" even though she lives with seven men , she\\'s not easy ! \" ) \\nfarquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected , lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne , the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds . \\nshrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest , accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend . \\nthey finally hook up with the princess , only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet . \\nfor the matter , the dragon offers a few surprises as well . \\nthe movie references a great many other flicks , from \" babe \" ( \" that\\'ll do , donkey . \\nthat\\'ll do \" ) to \" the graduate . \" \\nbut the lion\\'s share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney . \\nthe public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a \" possessed toy \" and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin , he bellows , \" get that dead broad off the table ! \" \\n ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaad\\'s royal domicile , which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom , from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like \" it\\'s a small world . \" \\nwhich brings me to disturbing point number one . \\ni laughed at all the disney swipes , but found the mentality behind them a bit sad . \\nthe acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known . \\nfor years the two companies have tried to sabotage each other\\'s film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day . \\nand now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer . \\nhere\\'s a suggestion for the two boys : grow up ! \\nput the past behind you ! \\nthere\\'s room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads can\\'t play nice , then go to your rooms ! \\nthe other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad . \\nbeyond all the irreverence , \" shrek \" actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances , because true beauty lies within . \\nit\\'s a lovely notion , but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaad\\'s diminutive stature . \\ndo we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ? \\nthe pompous , selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers . \\nadding short jokes is simply mean . \\nstill , \" shrek \" is a rollicking good time . \\nthe computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky ) , the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy ) , the laughs come fast and furious , and the moral , tainted though it may be , is a good one . \\nto trot out a clich ? , \" shrek \" is fun for all ages . \\nparents , though , should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short , tall , skinny , fat , etc . is a bad thing . \\n',\n",
       " b'there is a scene in patch adams in which patch is in the center of a courtroom , surrounded by people who are giving him a lively standing ovation because of his strong-worded attack on a group of stoic doctors . \\nwhen i noticed that the audience with whom i saw this film was reacting the same way , i realized that i was going to have a hard time finding someone who agrees with me about the quality of the picture . \\nyou see , patch adams revolted me beyond all boundaries . \\ni hated this movie for every second that i sat watching it , and i actively hate it now , days later , with the simpering , superficial , nauseatingly sentimental images forever plaguing my memories . \\ni hate every element of the film , beginning with tom shadyac\\'s shameless direction , and all the way up to the misguided and mishandled themes that the screenplay wants so desperately to convey . \\nthe badness of patch adams is stupefying . \\nit\\'s confounding . \\ni can\\'t believe a film can be this bad . \\nand yet , it\\'s based on a real man who probably has a good point to make . \\nin the film , patch is played by the undefeatable and indefatigable robin williams , in a performance of such insulting pathos and sledgehammer sympathy that i wonder now if he is even human . \\nin the beginning of the film , patch commits himself to a mental institution because he doesn\\'t want to kill himself . \\nwhile there , he notices that the doctors don\\'t care about the patients , and that the best way to get through to the patients is to treat them like human beings . \\nso , patch goes on a crusade to be a great doctor who actually talks to his patients . \\nhe goes to medical school , where he meets truman ( daniel london ) and convinces him that it\\'s good to help people . \\nhe also meets carin fischer ( monica potters ) , the anti-male med student who just wants to go through the motions and be a successful doctor . \\nnaturally , the dean of the medical school ( bob gunton ) hates patch , and wants to thwart his plans , even though patch gets the highest scores on all of his exams . \\nso patch decides that he\\'s going to build a free clinic in the middle of nowhere to help people with any problem they may have . \\nand that , my friends , is the synopsis for what is easily the most abhorrent picture of 1998 . \\non a superficial level , the film is not particularly bad : i wouldn\\'t say the cinematography bothered me , and most of the performances seem to be exactly what shadyac was aiming for ( i actually liked potter\\'s performance , even if she is wasted ) . \\nbut the film fails fundamentally in execution . \\nevery scene swells with grand , \" emotional \" music , played at maximum volume just to get us all to cry real hard . \\ntake , for instance , the first scene , which shows patch sitting on a bus . \\nwe don\\'t know patch yet , but there\\'s sad music , and it\\'s supposed to make us really sad that he\\'s sad . \\nlater on , patch makes a lot of progress : he helps a dying patient ( peter coyote ) to enjoy the last days of his life , and the music as patch is pushing the patient recklessly through the halls of the hospital is very lively . \\nand when that patient finally dies ( spoiler alert ! ) , the music is very very sad . \\nbut the problem with all of this is that the music should not be the center of the emotions . \\nreal drama is character-based . \\nyou grow to like someone , and then something bad happens , and you feel it . \\nwe don\\'t ever grow to know the dying patient ; he\\'s simply a vehicle for patch\\'s greatness . \\nreal drama doesn\\'t seem forced , or present just to make the audience cry . \\nthat\\'s why patch adams is not real drama . \\nit goes for every cheap tear imaginable , wringing tired and overbearing sentimentality out of every scene . \\neven scenes that have very little impact on the overall film are drowning in marc shaiman\\'s sickening musical score . \\nsentimentality like this is indeed bad . \\nbut it\\'s not as bad as half-baked , simplistic themes . \\nyou see , patch is a really great student . \\nhe aces his tests without studying , and does it so effectively that people think he\\'s cheating . \\nbut patch doesn\\'t think that memorizing facts is the way to become a good doctor . \\n \" why don\\'t we see patients until the third year ? \" he bursts out every three seconds . \\nwell , patch , that might have something to do with the fact that you need to learn something before you go treating patients . \\nnot everyone has the capability of memorizing facts with no effort . \\nmost of us have to study . \\nand a doctor who really wants to help , but doesn\\'t know a toe from a finger , probably won\\'t be too successful in preventing death . \\noh wait , i almost forgot : the point of doctors is not just to \" prevent death , \" but to \" improve the quality of life ! \" \\nyes ! \\nthat is true ! \\nand you can not do that without studying . \\nyou can not do that without going to medical school . \\nwhat patch never seemed to understand was the possibility that maybe , just maybe , it is a good idea to study first and talk to patients later . \\nfollow the rules ? \\nbah ! \\nwho needs the rules ! \\nonly uptight doctors follow the rules . \\nthe real saviors are the ones running around the hospitals with big red spheres on their faces and sporting baggy yellow pants . \\nand then there\\'s the free clinic issue , which i find shockingly , frighteningly idealistic . \\na free clinic . \\nin the middle of the forest . \\nwhere patients can be taken to be helped . \\nfor free . \\nhow will patients be transported to the free clinic ? \\nwill it have an emergency room ? \\nor is it just for mental patients ? \\nand who , may i ask , will pay for it ? \\nthe film does give some token attempts to question patch\\'s motives ( i think another character asks him how he\\'s going to pay for it , in addition to a little bit of meaningless blather about hmos and medical insurance ) , but they certainly don\\'t explore or challenge patch\\'s ideas to any meaningful extent . \\nreader , please understand this : i am not making any kind of judgment on the real patch adams . \\ni know nothing about him . \\nif his beliefs mirror those of this film character , then i might like to have an intelligent discussion with him about them . \\nbut regardless of what the real patch adams believes , the themes put forth in this film are simplistic and phony . \\nand in the last scene , the big , obligatory courtroom scene that forced my lunch halfway up my esophagus , patch does a lot of shouting . \\nactually , robin williams does a lot of shouting . \\nhe shouts a lot about helping people , and a lot of people cry because they are moved by his words . \\ni won\\'t tell you that you can\\'t be moved by his words , because i , too , was moved by his words . \\ni was moved in such a profoundly negative way that i was reminded of how cheap and phony a cinematic experience can be . \\npatch adams is the cheapest of them all . \\n',\n",

       " b'labelling is sometimes everything . \\nin original mad max , the opening title set the plot of the movie in near future , thus making it one of the science fiction classics , despite the future world being almost exactly like our own . \\nwalter hill wanted the same opening title for his action classic the warriors . \\nproducers weren\\'t thrilled by that idea and consequently the movie lost all of its futuristic overtones . \\non the other hand , producers were right on the mark ; walter hill was accused of actually promoting some disturbing trends that were quite visible in contemporary america . \\nto make the movie even more distant from future , plot was loosely based on anabasis , historical book written by xenophon , greek mercenary soldier who had described his adventures in ancient persia 2400 years ago . \\ninstead of ancient persia , movie begins in contemporary coney island , where cleon ( dorsey wright ) , leader of the warriors , local youth gang , gets invitation to the great gathering of all youth gangs from the city . \\nthe gathering , organised by gramercy park riffs , most powerful gang in the city , is taking place in bronx . \\nthat is far away from warriors\\' home territory , but small and unarmed delegation of the warriors gets there safely thanks to the general truce . \\non the gathering , cyrus ( roger hill ) , charismatic leader of the riffs , announces his grand plan to unite all the gangs and take over the city . \\ncrowd is enthusiastic , but the small gang of rogues , led by psychopathic luther ( david patrick kelly ) uses the opportunity to assassinate cyrus . \\npolice simultaneously raids the gathering , and in the commotion warriors get blamed by the killing , and their leader gets killed by riffs . \\nthe remaining eight , led by cleon\\'s lieutenant swann ( michael beck ) , must now try to get to coney island , but this time unprotected by truce and instead being chased by all the gangs . \\nupon its release , despite the controversies and even some youth riots that were allegedly inspired by it , the warriors enjoyed immense popularity and very quickly received some kind of a cult status . \\nhowever , despite being one of the best movies of that year , and being directed by talented action director walter hill at the peak of his career , the movie failed to leave as strong impression to the future generations as some other cinematic achievements of that same year . \\nthe reason for that probably lies in a fact that this movie aged very quickly . \\nif walter hill\\'s idea was to warn the public about problems of urban america , he failed miserably . \\nthe future was much worse than his vision . \\nthe youth gangs , as presented in the warriors , are far from shadowy armies , able to take over entire cities . \\ntheir members seem more interested in unorthodox fashion and their little petty feuds than such prosaic , and for the public more annoying , matters like crime . \\nin their vocabulary , word \" arms \" is reserved for small knives and blunt objects , and only few of them use heavy artillery like handguns . \\nthey even have their own , very strict and detailed laws , upheld more strictly than some governments do with their own . \\nmany people in american cities would be more than happy to see their young criminals behaving like those in the warriors . \\nsome of the critics who accused hill of actually praising youth crime had a lot arguments in their favour . \\ndespite those objections , the warriors have all the elements of a very good film . \\nthe plot is simple , and serves as good basis for numerous action scenes . \\nthe fights are brilliantly choreographed and quite realistic , although there isn\\'t much bloodshed or gore in the movie . \\nediting is superb , events happen at quick pace , with the exception of middle , when boring moralistic exchanges between swann and his would-be-girlfriend mercy ( deborah van valkenburgh ) drag the plot from straight action to social drama territory . \\nthe soundtrack by barry de vorzon is very suggestive and recognisable . \\nyet , the trademark of this film are the actors who showed great talent , although most of them later sunk into anonymity . \\nbest known of them is david patrick kelly , whose superb and original performance in this film later subscribed him to the roles of psychopathic villains . \\nmichael beck as cool , almost statesman-like leader of a gang , is also very good , and james remar gives good contrast as his hot-shot contender for top spot . \\nall in all , this movie is perhaps dated , yet in its hour and half can give a lot more entertainment than most of the contemporary movies . \\n',\n",

       " b\"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether . \\ni've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce . \\nas it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton . \\nit's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star . \\nnorton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year . \\nhe plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) . \\nthe film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car . \\nwe find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny . \\nin the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother . \\nmuch of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy . \\nwhen derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things . \\nwhat makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms . \\nit's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material . \\nbecause american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic . \\ni partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart . \\nthe reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men . \\nit's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up . \\nof course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part . \\nit's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest . \\nin addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease . \\neven when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead . \\nwhat adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny . \\nthe other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien . \\nvisually , the film is very powerful . \\nkaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere . \\nbut , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes . \\nalthough the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed . \\nfor a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way . \\nit makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film . \\nperhaps this last scene was the problem . \\nit's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way . \\n\",\n",

       " b'capsule : the much anticipated re-adaptation of the pierre boulle novel comes to the screen as a dark and a little dreary film with lots of chases and fighting , but very little intelligence . \\nvisually there is much to like about this version , but the approach is to take an adventure after the style of gulliver\\'s travels and treat it as an action film . \\nthat makes it a film without much center . \\n , 0 ( -4 to +4 ) \\npierre boulle , author of the bridge on the river kwai , wrote planet of the apes ( a . k . a . monkey planet ) , the novel , as a social satire . \\nit reads a lot like a fifth book of gulliver\\'s travels . \\nhumans discover a planet in which the roles of apes and humans have been reversed , not unlike the roles of horses and humans on jonathan swift\\'s island of the houyhnhnms . \\nthe novel moves somewhat slowly to create some suspense in revealing all the things most film fans know to be true about the nature of the planet . \\nit seems to me there is also a statement about human cruelty to animals , but perhaps i was just looking for that . \\nwhen rod serling adapted the novel into a film released in 1968 , he added a number of serling touches , familiar from episodes of the twilight zone and changed the ending to make it more serling-ish . \\nthe final irony of the original version has become film history . \\nwithout it there could never have been a \" planet of the apes \" film series . \\ni can surmise only that serling ran into serious script problems in how to handle the tricky question of language . \\nin the book the apes had their own language and the human eventually learned that language . \\nthat could have been done in the film , but that would have required the entire film to be subtitled for the non-ape-speaking . \\nserling avoided this by having the apes speak english and , of course , there is some justification for that by the end of the film . \\njustifying why the apes spoke english may have even been the inspiration for his surprise ending . \\nbut serling never tackles the all-important question of why a supposedly intelligent human never shows any curiosity or even surprise that the apes speak his own language , a language they had no opportunity to ever hear . \\nfew viewers questioned this serious plot hole , however , and the film has become well respected in cinema history . \\npartial credit at least should go to jerry goldsmith whose extremely inventive score is one of goldsmith\\'s best if not his best . \\nwhen the film\\'s success called for sequels , the filmmakers turned up the violence and they added well-intentioned , though not very subtle , political messages about what was happening in the united states of the 1960s and 1970s . \\nwhile the first film had a little shooting of guns and what was there seemed a little half- hearted , by the second film , beneath the planet of the apes , there was a good deal more violence and from that point on the series had a lot of violence and chases . \\nthe series concluded with battle for the planet of the apes in 1973 . \\nnow director tim burton tries his hand at adapting the original book again . \\nfor those who thought that the 1968 version was not very faithful to the book , burton\\'s new version is even less faithful . \\nfirst , he does not really reverse the roles of the humans and the apes . \\nhe has them both be intelligent , articulate races battling for a dominance of the planet currently in the hands , uh , make that paws , of the apes . \\nthat could be a good story too , but it is not planet of the apes . \\nas with the mission impossible films and so many other cinematic homages to the third quarter of the last century , the title makes promises that the filmmakers have no intention of honoring . \\nin 2029 leo davidson ( mark wahlberg , not this world\\'s most expressive actor ) works on a space station increasing the intelligence and usefulness of apes . \\nthen a convenient time storm sweeps him up wizard-of-oz-fashion and drops him on an alien planet . \\n ( yes , he survives this storm , but then no storm is perfect . ) \\nhe quickly finds , not greatly to any surprise he shows , that on this planet apes rule and humans drool , but everybody talks . \\nand the language they talk is earth- english . \\napparently it does not even occur to leo that there is a mystery that needs to be explained about that . \\nthe fact it does not occur to leo and apparently didn\\'t occur to tim burton either is the heart of the real horror of this film . \\nboth just assumed that if apes were going to talk the language they would speak would be english . \\nin any case having one talking race dominating another makes this not a look at human-animal relationships and more one of the master-slave relationships . \\noutside of sudan and a few other countries this is a less relevant topic . \\nleo is captured to be used as a slave but also is discovered by ari , played by helena bonham carter . \\nari is an attractive ape with close ties to high political power . \\nshe is bent on making the world a better place . \\nperhaps in a previous draft of the script she was called hil-ari . \\nin any case with makeup that stifles her usual pout , carter is just about as attractive as she has ever been in a film . \\nshe may want to consider this to become her standard look from this point forward . \\nit is not long before leo escapes with some human and only a couple of sympathetic apes . \\nthis is a further abandonment of the source material . \\nthe chase severely limits the interplay of ape and human and the examination of each\\'s place in this reversed society , each important in the book . \\nwe cannot see how the society works because most of the screentime society has broken down . \\nwe see the humans either separated from the apes or fighting them . \\nburton chooses visceral thrills over cerebral ones at almost every turn . \\nthis is a miscalculation , as characters so lacking in empathy value are difficult ones to place much emotional investment in . \\nthey are basically chess pieces and the viewer has little reason to root for them to win . \\nthe 1968 script had little subtlety , with lines like \" i never met an ape i didn\\'t like , \" but at least we cared for what happened to taylor , the main character . \\nmost of what this film has to offer is in the visuals . \\nthe visual work is spotty but generally nicely done except that so much of the film takes place in the night or in fog . \\nthis tends to limit close looks at the makeup . \\nin general it seems much improved from 1968 . \\nthe makeup team is led by rick baker instead of john chambers , who did it for the 1968 version . \\nin 1968 chambers makeup was a jaw-dropper . \\nit was realistic enough to almost be believable but flexible enough to show emotion . \\nchambers is good , but if anyone had a chance to best him it would have to be baker . \\ntoday audiences have higher expectations ; baker\\'s visualization is really an improvement . \\nthese visuals work nicely . \\nwhat does not work is the wire- assisted leaps some of the apes make . \\nthey look like they were inspired by the physics- defying leaps of crouching tiger , hidden dragon . \\napes spring incredible distances . \\nsome of the best scenes are apes running into battle looking like they have ape posture , but when they start flying through the air the effect is lost . \\none final visual problem is that the film frequently shows its budget in what should be spectacular battle scenes the camera shows us only a small group of people close-up . \\nsince the days of lon chaney and boris karloff few actors have crossed over to stardom in a role that required heavy make-up . \\nthe one actor who has a shot is paul giamatti . \\nit is not that his lines are so good , most are silly jokes . \\nbut he delivers them very well . \\nhe was always a watchable actor , but has not yet made stardom . \\nas the ape-trader limbo he over-emotes to overcome his ape make-up , but does it very well . \\nin doing so he makes himself the most interesting thing on the screen . \\nhe is probably the best thing in the film and conjures up memories of peter ustinov\\'s performance in spartacus . \\nas an in-joke there are several lines in the script borrowed from the 1968 film and an old ape played by charleton heston becomes an allusion to the first film by itself . \\ndanny elfman\\'s score has a

       " b'a remake of the 1978 warren beatty vehicle \" heaven can wait \" ( which in turn was a remake of \" here comes mr . jordan \" ) , \" down to earth \" tells the tale of lance barton ( chris rock , \" lethal weapon iv \" ) , a young black standup comic trying to win over the audience at harlem\\'s apollo theater . \\nwhen he\\'s taken to heaven prematurely by bumbling angel keyes ( eugene levy , \" best in show \" ) , his only recourse is to return in another body . \\nhe chooses that of charles wellington , the tenth richest man in the united states . \\nof course , wellington is not only rich , but white and 53 years old , which makes lance\\'s bid for closing night at the apollo , as well as his desire to woo suntee ( regina taylor , \" jerry maguire \" ) , a tad tricky . \\nthe original elaine may/warren beatty script has been reworked by chris rock , lance crouther , ali leroi , and louis c . k . \\nto turn beatty\\'s vehicle as a football player into rock\\'s vehicle as a comic and add some racial humor . \\nas directed by chris weitz and paul weitz ( codirectors of \" american pie \" and costars of \" chuck & buck \" ) , the whole affair comes off as amateur hour . \\ninitial scenes play like filmed line reading rehearsals . \\nproduction values are shoddy . \\nmost serious of all is the use of rock when his wellington counterpart would have been more appropriate . \\nthis problem is clearly attributable to the fact that the old white guy is never lip or action synched when he is on screen . \\nrock does get the chance to do some fun schtick , such as his turnaround on wellington\\'s plans for a poor neighborhood hospital ( \\'bullet in the head ? \\nyou got a bed ! \\' ) , but he\\'s uneven when interacting with the rest of the cast . \\nregina taylor fares well amidst the mediocrity as the young activist who confusedly ends up falling for the man she believed to be her nemesis . \\nalso good is frankie faison ( \" hannibal \" ) as whitney , lance\\'s compassionate manager - the only human who\\'s made privy to lance\\'s body body switch . \\nchaz palminteri and levy are pretty much wasted as heaven\\'s ambassadors . \\nanother \" best in show \" alumnus , jennifer coolidge , is poorly used as wellington\\'s cheating wife ( and shown several days apart wearing the same outfit ? ! ) and greg germann ( tv\\'s \" ally mcbeal , \" \" sweet november \" ) continues display his sitcom roots as her lover and husband\\'s lawyer . \\nmark addy ( \" the full monty \" ) is sorely underutilized as cisco , wellington\\'s fake english butler . \\nstealing the show in every scene she\\'s in is wanda sykes ( \" the chris rock show \" ) as wellington\\'s disgruntled maid . \\n \" down to earth \" is for chris rock fans only . \\nall others should go rent \" heaven can wait \" or truly be brought down to earth . \\n',\n",
       " b'mpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg , for martial-arts violence . ) \\nwith three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america , and at least three more on their way , jackie chan is one of the newest \" hot properties \" in action adventure stardom , and it\\'s just about time . \\nfor over twenty-five years , jackie\\'s been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong , thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy . \\n \" drunken master \" has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to \" make it big \" --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong . \\ni\\'m not entirely sure why , exactly . \\nin many ways , \" drunken master \" is similar to most of jackie\\'s other early films , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii , \" master with cracked fingers \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , \" spiritual kung fu \" , and others . \\nin fact , looking at all these early films together , one gets the impression that they were stamped out , cookie-cutter style , at a rate of four to six per year , all using the same casts and telling very similar stories . \\nto be honest , i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste . \\nthey\\'re quite different from action movies as we know them in america . \\nthese films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past , with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together . \\n \" drunken master \" , though its plot is tighter than some , is no exception . \\n ( as an aside , \" drunken master \" was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw , and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in \\na movie theater in seattle , as part of an asian film festival . \\nat the time , i didn\\'t really think it was anything special . . . but \\nafter having seen more films like it , it\\'s kind of grown on me . ) \\n \" drunken master \" \\'s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies , such as \" fearless hyena \" i and ii and \" master with cracked fingers \" --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master , and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been \" adapted , \" to put it kindly , by american films such as karate kid ) . \\nmore specifically , jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong , aka \" naughty panther , \" a fun-loving , practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good , but not _quite_ good enough . \\nafter embarrassing his instructor\\'s assistant by beating him roundly , then beating up a bully in a marketplace , wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl , but discovers that she , and her mother , can hit back , better than he can . . . and \\nis further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt , respectively . \\nhis father , wong kei-ying , is unhappy about this , and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages . \\nkei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment , which fei-hong does not like at all . \\nwhile escaping from this punishment , fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man , who proceeds to thrash him soundly , then take him on as a student and thrash him some more . \\nthis turns out to be su hua-chi , a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu . \\nhe assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks , such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame , cracking walnuts with his hands , and other such exercises , that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up . \\nthen , when he\\'s ready , he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu . \\nunfortunately , the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . . \\n \" drunken master \" features some wonderful martial arts sequences , with jackie winning some fights and losing others . \\nit\\'s been said before , but i\\'ll say it again--these fights don\\'t just _happen_ , they\\'re as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance , and it shows . \\nin his fights , jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches , jugs , cups , bowls , fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways . \\nthe fight scenes , particularly those toward the end of the film , are unparallelled in most american films . \\nwhether jackie wins or loses , it\\'s really something to see . . . and \\nit\\'s often as funny as anything , too . \\nand funny is the other thing jackie chan is very , very good at . \\nthere\\'s very little that\\'s new in this movie--jackie winning fights , jackie getting beaten badly by a master , jackie going through punishment or training . . . these \\nschticks have all been seen before , in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties . \\nbut they\\'re still hilarious as ever . \\nlikewise , jackie has a _great_ supporting cast , many of whom were also in other early jackie films , and they\\'re often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own . \\nthe really big thing about \" drunken master \" , though , that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later , was the drunken-style kung fu . \\ni\\'m not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu , but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and \\nit apparently helps if you\\'re drunk while you\\'re doing it . \\ngenuine or not , i have to admit , there\\'s just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize what\\'s going on . \\ncome to think of it , perhaps this element is what accounts for this film\\'s success over any of the other jackie films . . . it\\'s \\nnot just martial arts , it\\'s the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go , \" whoa . . . \" \\non the negative side , the cinematography in this film is nothing special , the film stock is rather primitive , the plot is often rather slow , and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background . \\n \" gone with the wind \" , this isn\\'t . \\nstill , if you like martial arts films , or like what you\\'ve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more , give it a shot . \\nit\\'s much more \" real \" than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme . \\nyou might very well like it . \\nanother interesting thing about \" drunken master \" has to do with its video availability in the us . \\n \" drunken master \" is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original , letterboxed , hong kong subtitled form , commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video , in a gold box , for about $10 ) . \\nthere are plenty of other early jackie films around , but these are typically either in dubbed , pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase . \\nthankfully , \" drunken master \" , at least , is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen , at a very affordable price . \\nif you like \" drunken master \" , take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones aren\\'t really _too_ bad . . . if \\nnothing else , you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) . \\ni particularly recommend \" spiritual kung fu \" , \" half a loaf of kung fu \" , the \" fearless hyena \" movies , and \" snake & crane arts of shaolin \" . \\nalso , the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel , \" drunken master ii \" , will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer . \\nalso , for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore ) , i\\'ve been told to suggest the \" once upon a time in china \" series starring jet li ( though i haven\\'t personally seen any of them yet ) . \\nif you choose to watch \" drunken master \" , i really hope you enjoy it , and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema that\\'s out there . \\nall in all , i give this film an . \\n',\n",

       " b'slavery is bad . \\nafter hundreds of years , we\\'ve finally figured that one out . \\nthis almost universal belief is the both the strength and weakness of director steven spielberg\\'s latest \" serious \" film . \\nduring the late 1830s , a portuguese slave ship carries a cargo of black men and women kidnapped from their home on africa\\'s west coast to cuba to be sold into slavery . \\nfifty-three of them are stuffed into the \" la amistad \" ( from a spanish word for \" friendship \" ) by their new spanish owners . \\nfreeing himself from his chains , senge pieh ( djimon hounsou ) , renamed cinque by his masters , leads a bloody revolt . \\nafter killing most of the crew , the africans force the remaining sailors to return them to their home - or so they think . \\ninstead the ship heads up the coast to the united states . \\nthe amistad is boarded by an american naval ship and the revolutionaries are put on trial in connecticut for murder and piracy . \\nthe legal question becomes are they free men fighting justly for their freedom or are they property . \\nif they are property , who do they belong to ? \\ntheir masters ? \\nthe spanish government ? \\nsalvage rights of the officers who captured the ship ? \\nthe us government ? \\nthe defendants are pawns in several games . \\nabolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) want to free them , but tappan sees them primarily as a means to further the cause . \\ntheir lawyer roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) views the case as a simple one of property rights and a chance to make his share of legal fees . \\nsouth carolina senator john c . calhoun ( arliss howard ) pursues the case for the political advancement of the southern states . \\npresident martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) is willing to force the result towards his own political ends . \\nwhen the verdict looks to free the africans , van buren replaces the judge with one more sympathetic to his wishes . \\neven that doesn\\'t work and the new judge frees the kidnap victims . \\nat the urging of calhoun , the president then appeals the case to the supreme court , populated by a majority of slave-owners . \\nthis little-known ( try finding it in any history text book ) incident from america\\'s past would have gone down a darker path were it not for former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) who is persuaded to argue the case before the supreme court . \\nthe slavery issue is easy pickin\\'s for spielberg . \\nmuch like his \" shindler\\'s list \" ( which followed \" jurassic park \" as this follows \" lost world \" ) , the moral sides are not difficult ones to choose . \\nnazis and slave traders : both treat groups of others as less than human . \\nit\\'s not hard to see who the bad guys are . \\nwithout that question to ponder , the director\\'s job is more difficult . \\nhe has to make the story interesting . \\nspielberg succeeds for the most part . \\nthe visual aspect of the film is beyond reproach . \\nwhere the movie falls down is a bit more subtle . \\nthere are very few _people_ in the tale . \\nin fact , cinque is the only character who is fleshed out . \\ntappan and joadson are \" abolitionists \" : symbols but not humans . \\nvan buren is a weak politician but nothing else . \\nthe rest of the \" slaves \" barely exist other than dressing for the set . \\nlike many other films about people of color , almost all the major players are white . \\nthe film\\'s salvation lies in the acting strength of everyone involved and the powerful presence of hounsou . \\nthe former model\\'s first major role is a winner . \\nwithout speaking more than five words of english , he conveys more emotion than most actors with a thousand lines of dialog . \\nthe other stand-out is hopkins who seems to be making a career out of portraying american presidents ( he also played the title role in \" nixon \" ) . \\nthe impassioned speech by the doddering old man who phases in and out of rationality is among the best court-room drama ever on the screen . \\nthere are some other great moments . \\nespecially impressive are the african\\'s struggle to understand what is going on in the strange land . \\ntheir interpretation of the bible based solely on the pictures and their own experiences is poignant . \\nas grand as the epic is , it would have more impact had it focused more on the experience from the point of view of the africans . \\nmore humanity in the fight for humanity would have made it a four-star film . \\n ( michael redman has written this column for a real long time and is just now getting around to seeing some 1998 films . ) \\n',\n",
       " b\"while i am not fond of any writer's use of cheap , easy puns , i am not completely above using them myself when the situation merits it ( witness my review of _pecker_ from a couple of issues ago ) . \\nso here goes : the juvenile , college-set black comedy _dead_man_on_campus_ is dead on arrival . \\nstrait-laced med student josh ( tom everett scott , who manages to remain somewhat likable throughout ) 's blemish-free academic record breaks out into fs , thanks to the influence of his ever-partying roommate , cooper ( mark-paul gosselaar ) , who introduces josh to the sex- and booze-filled nights that come with university life . \\nwith the threat of losing an academic scholarship ( josh ) and a life cleaning toilets for his dad looming ( cooper ) , what are two good-hearted slackers to do ? \\neasy--look for a loophole , which they find in the form of an unbelievable rule in the school charter that states that if a student's ( or students' ) roommate commits suicide , the surviving student ( s ) shall receive straight as . \\nso instead of studying , josh and cooper attempt to seek out the most depressed student out there , move him into their dorm room , and drive him to suicide before the semester ends . \\ndirector alan cohn and screenwriters michael traeger and mike white ( working from a story by anthony abrams and adam larson broder ) take their sweet time to build the head of steam that comes with josh and cooper's diabolical plot . \\nuntil then , the usual boring cliches of college life ( booze , sex , more booze ) fill the time , which is made to feel longer by _saved_by_the_bell_ alumnus gosselaar's sitcom-bred mugging . \\nthat said , once cohn and company do build some comic momentum , they mishandle it . \\nthe introduction of the manic , psychotic cliff ( lochlyn munro ) , a potential roommate for josh and cooper , brings some demented life to the uninspired proceedings before being hastily written out in favor of two less interesting candidates : paranoid nerd buckley ( randy pearlstein ) and british death rocker matt ( corey page ) . \\none wishes that cliff would reappear , but , as they say , be careful what you wish for . \\nnot surprisingly , he does resurface , and it then becomes clear that this is a character that is best taken in a small dose ; almost immediately , his extended boorish and sociopathic antics loses its novelty . \\nthe same can be said about all of _dead_man_on_campus_ . \\nwhatever morbid appeal the far-fetched premise has quickly evaporates , and the self-absorbed characters , especially cooper , pretty much grate from the get-go . \\n_dead_man_ doesn't grow tiresome ; it already _is_ once the clever opening titles are through . \\nas it slogs along to a cheesy , happy-for-all-parties conclusion , _dead_man_ lives up to its title and then some--not only does the movie grow even more tired and die , it still insists on going on . . . \\nlike a zombie . \\n\",\n",
       " b'not since attending an ingmar bergman retrospective a few years ago have i seen a film as uncompromising in its portrayal of emotional truth as secrets & lies . \\nlike bergman , director mike leigh is interested in probing his characters\\' inner depths through hypernaturally blunt confrontations . \\nalso like bergman , leigh engages in frequent closeups of his characters\\' ravished and wracked faces . \\nand the prominent mournfulness of a cello on the soundtrack recalls bergman\\'s own use of a bach cello suite in an earlier film . \\nall that is missing is a discussion of god . \\nwhich is not to say that secrets & lies is nothing more than an homage to the swedish master . \\nin fact , it is quite possible leigh had no such intentions in mind . \\nnonetheless , what we get is so far removed from the average moviegoing experience -- even from the reason we go to the movies in the first place -- that it takes some effort to adjust to the film\\'s rhythms . \\nonce the adjustment is made , however , there are great rewards . \\none such is the chance to see life on the screen as it really is . \\nthough leigh may have adopted some of bergman\\'s stylistic touches , most obviously in an early scene of terse cross-cutting during a married couple\\'s strained conversation , as well as in that somewhat obtrusive score , the overall feeling of the film is that it eschews any \" style \" at all . \\nwhereas bergman uses artifice as a tool to expose reality , leigh makes the camera a mere observer , almost as in a pbs documentary . \\nthe effect of this is to focus all of your attention on the actors . \\nit is a tribute to everyone involved that , despite such scrutiny , only infrequently are we aware that anyone * is * acting . \\nmuch has been made of brenda blethyn\\'s performance , and rightly so , but it is only when you remind yourself that you are watching a fiction that you realize how good she is . \\nthere are a few missteps . \\nfor one , except for one scene ( tragicomic , as it happens ) , there is scant humor in the film . \\nthis leads to a certain monotonous tone throughout . \\nand occasionally ( as with bergman ) the bluntness of the situations can seem forced . \\nfor all that , this longish film manages to keep hold of your attention . \\nit is unfortunate that the audience for secrets & lies will most likely be limited to an intellectual elite , for there is nothing inherently intellectual about this film . \\nin fact , it might easily resonate more strongly for millions of working class filmgoers who will likely never see it . \\nthere is even a sweet but significant irony in the film\\'s unspoken take on race relations , something an american audience at least would do well to observe . \\nnonetheless , secrets & lies is not for the faint of heart . \\nthough there is nothing physically horrific to make one squeamish , the exploration of common human frailty can be so raw and unsparing that it is tempting to turn from the screen . \\nneedless to say , it is also very depressing at times . \\nbut for many of us , of course , so is life . \\nand though the film is too honest to tack on a phony happy ending , that same honesty allows it to admit that things can also get better . \\n',\n",
       " b'it has happened again . \\na movie that is well scripted , well acted , and well directed . \\nit is involving , suspenseful . . . \\nit even has an unexpected twist at the end that packs a punch like a blow to the solar plexus . \\nbut in order to accept its premise one must also accept a spiritual lie . \\nthe sixth sense is that movie . \\nstarring bruce willis ( armageddon ) as a child psychologist and haley joel osment ( forrest gump ) as a troubled youngster , the sixth sense is more spooky than scary , though it does contain disturbing images designed to startle . \\neight-year-old cole sear ( osment ) sees dead people . \\nnot just in dreams . \\nand not just as lifeless bodies . \\nhe sees them walking around like regular people . \\nand he sees them all the time . \\ndr . malcolm crowe ( willis ) is trying to help him . \\nhe recognizes in cole many of the same attributes as one of his earlier patients whom crowe failed , resulting in that patient shooting crowe before turning the gun on himself . \\nif crowe could manage to find a way to help cole , he believes he just might be able to put his own demons to rest . \\nbut first he needs to gain cole\\'s trust . \\nthe boy is so frightened by what he sees , he has closed himself off emotionally , being unwilling to tell anyone . . . \\nnot crowe , not even his own mother ( toni collette , clockwatchers ) . . . \\nabout his \" secrets . \" \\ncrowe begins to spend more and more time with him , even as his own marriage starts to dissolve around him , his wife anna ( olivia williams , rushmore ) becoming cold and distant because of his neglect of her and his preoccupation with the boy . \\nbruce willis underplays his role , allowing the excellent script to do most of the work of building character development . \\ncrowe moves from treating a troubled boy who won\\'t communicate , to treating a troubled boy who is having hallucinations , to wondering if perhaps there isn\\'t some truth behind what the boy sees . \\nmr . willis does a serviceable job , letting the focus remain on the story instead of on his familiar action hero screen persona . \\neleven-year-old haley joel osment manages to impress us with his performance . \\nhe demonstrates an amazing amount of self-composure as well as an ability to play nuances in a complex character as if he were a seasoned pro . \\nit is fine work for one of such a tender age . \\nkeep your eye on this young man . \\nthe supporting cast is also quite effective . \\ntoni collette , as the confused , frightened , and frustrated mother who can\\'t understand what is happening to her child ; olivia williams , as crowe\\'s once loving wife who is shutting down emotionally due to the lack of attention from her husband ; and donnie wahlberg ( ransom ) as crowe\\'s ex-patient , now grown , who illustrates his doctor\\'s failure to help him in the most vivid terms imaginable . \\ntwenty-eight year old m . night shyamalan ( wide awake ) directed his own script , maintaining a proper tension throughout the film and crafting the storytelling so expertly that the film\\'s full impact is not reached until its final moments , when a surprising revelation forces a reevaluation of all that preceded it . \\nit is a rare movie which manages to pull that off and mr . shyamalan , as the one responsible , is certainly to be commended . \\nin giving the sixth sense a favorable \" three star \" review for its craftsmanship and artistic merit , i must also point out that , spiritually speaking , the film is highly misleading . \\nthere is no scriptural foundation upon which to base a belief in ghosts or the \" living dead . \" \\nthe concept of death being a doorway to another plane of existence is a devilish lie that has been around as long as man himself . \\nthe first lie recorded in the bible was devised by the serpent who assured eve , \" thou shall not surely die , \" a direct contradiction of god\\'s admonition . \\nthat same lie has been perpetuated ad infinitum throughout the ages . \\nscriptures do speak of a time when the dead shall rise but that wonderful demonstration of victory over death will not commence until after the second coming of christ . . . \\nan event which has not yet occurred . \\ntherefore , the dead remain in a state of oblivion , having no consciousness , until that long-awaited time when the final trump shall sound . \\nand then , you\\'ll need six senses to register all the joy and rejoicing that will resound throughout the heavens . \\n',\n",
       " b\"the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it's association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \\ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \\nthis time , he's after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he's been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \\nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \\nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \\nbut even on it's own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \\nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film's overlong running time . \\nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it's trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \\nto be honest , i couldn't care less if snipe's character got captured or not . \\nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i'll explain later . \\ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \\nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \\ni know it's the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \\nthere's a few 'nudge nudge' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \\nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \\ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who's roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \\nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \\nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it's face . \\nit doesn't fare any better plot-wise , either . \\nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \\nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \\nif this film wasn't the 'sequel' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it's so average . \\nand because of the film's plot changing it's course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \\nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there's no particular scene that stands out . \\nit's director is the usual action movie style . \\neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \\nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there's a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \\nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \\nsure , it's loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain't fun . \\nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \\noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \\n\",\n",

       " b'robin hood : men in tights is another mel-brooks-produced film in the classic tradition of movies like blazing saddles and young frankenstein . \\nmel brooks is well known for his comic look at regular life , his fast paced dialogue and sharp wit . \\nunfortunately , robin hood : men in tights has none of the easy going humor of blazing saddles , none of the fun acting of young frankenstein , is devoid of the charm of spaceballs , and is even lacking the good , solid dialogue of history of the world . \\nit is , in short , one of the worst movies i have seen mel brooks , or anybody else , produce . \\nthe plot borrows heavily from the well-received kevin costner movie of last year , robin hood : prince of thieves . \\nthis is not surprising in and of itself , and could have been used to great comic effect , mainly by parodying scenes from the orginal movie . \\nmel brooks does not take advantage of this , however , and uses the film to launch several ideas into the air , none of which connect and none of which are explained later on . \\nthe movie\\'s scenes could be shuffled around in any order and one would be hard pressed to notice . \\ncary elwes , of princess bride fame , plays robin of loxley , a man who was captured in the crusades , fighting with king richard . \\nhe escapes and , joining with a man named achoo ( i am sure you can see the obvious joke ) , fights in england to reclaim his name and the throne for richard , which has been captured by evil prince john , played by funny comic richard lewis . \\nhe also tries for the love of maid marian and attempts to overthrow the evil \" sheriff of rottingham \" . \\na good adventure plot that is sadly unused . \\nelwes and lewis are both excellent comics , but the dialogue in the movie is simply excruciating . \\nneither actor has any good words to work with , and the lines simply aren\\'t funny , nor believable . \\nperhaps the worst example of this is when the group of merry men encounter a man playing a macaulay culkin clone from the hit movie home alone . \\nthis particular scene is so out of place and so badly acted , and followed by so many other scenes of equal miserable ideas , that i really felt like leaving the theatre . \\nmuch of the audience continued to look at their watches throughout , and some left the theatre . \\nchuckles were few and far between , and they mostly dealt with visual jokes ( such as an old , beaten up horse from \" rent-a-wreck \" ) then from any dialogue whatsoever . \\nscenes that could have been classics , such as the archery contest , are ruined by poor acting . \\nperhaps the largest problem with the movie is that it is simply offensive . \\nthe basic plot , that robin has received a key that will unlock the chastity belt of maid marian , is not witty nor funny . \\nmel brooks as a circumcision-giving rabbi is also offensive to me and others in the audience ( not all jewish , either ) . \\nthe movie simply tries to hard trying to be funny and by and large fails . \\nthe addition of a blind man who stumbles around , falling off cliffs , walking into ledges and being a general buffoon could have had some humorous potential , but is also made terribly offensive . \\nthe only reason to see this movie is the surprise actor at the end who plays king richard . \\nhe is well worth waiting for , if you can stand an hour and half of unfunny dialogue , excruciating visual humor , old puns , ancient jokes and bad acting . \\nif you can\\'t , don\\'t even bother watching this miserable film . \\n',\n",

       " b'logical time travel movies are a near-impossibility . \\nconsidering that the skeptic\\'s best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities , writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task . \\noccasionally , we get a film that does manage it . \\nterry gilliam\\'s \" 12 monkeys \" was one such film . \\nbut more frequently , we get films that don\\'t much deal with it at all . \\nthere is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ? \\nthe \" terminator \" films made up for them with exciting action , \" back to the future \" did it with an entertaining story , and the new film \" frequency \" pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own . \\nis \" frequency \" filled with plot holes ? \\nyes . \\ndoes it matter ? \\nnot really . \\nthe film opens in october of 1969 . \\nfirefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job , then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) . \\nthe double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999 , where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective . \\na strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in \\'69 and that john has found in the present day . \\nthough both are initially skeptical of the idea , john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire , and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom . \\nnow flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive , john is initially overjoyed , until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women . \\nfrank and john now must work together to set things right , with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past . \\nthe premise of \" frequency \" is unusual , and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions . \\nthis isn\\'t explained ; you just have to go with it . \\nwhen frank doesn\\'t die in a fire , john is the only one who remembers it differently , while everyone else remembers it the new way . \\nthe concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other . \\nsometimes frank\\'s changing the past results in something happening right away in john\\'s world , and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time . \\nnow , the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this , and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example , the reason john gets advance information of the serial killer\\'s murders was because the change had already happened in frank\\'s world , and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change ) , but explanations aren\\'t really the point . \\nwhen \" frequency \" gets cooking , it\\'s a riveting little thriller , even if it is confusing . \\nwhat matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment , and \" frequency \" works as long as it keeps moving . \\nthe film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion . \\ndirector gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure \" frequency \" as good hollywood entertainment , establishing decent , likable characters , making us care for them , and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved . \\ni liked many of the creative touches : the split screens , allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities , and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward . \\nit actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin\\' mets ) to great effect -- frank uses john\\'s advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him . \\n ( admittedly , this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . ) \\ni even liked the final scene , which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods . \\nsome may find this scene blindingly confusing , as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious , but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway ) , and let\\'s face it : it\\'s a darn cool way to end the film . \\nthere are enough surprises and plot twists in \" frequency \" to keep you on your toes , and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant . \\nthe other major thing to appreciate about \" frequency \" is the handling of the father-son relationship . \\nquaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; it\\'s a rock-solid job from both actors . \\nthe relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative , or with a future descendant ? \\nwatching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question . \\nthe credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we don\\'t believe in the characters , we don\\'t care about the outcome of the thriller plot . \\nhere , we do care , because we like the lead actors . \\ni also liked some of the supporting cast members . \\nelizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles , playing julia the doting wife * and * mother , but still performs admirably . \\nandre braugher , late of the television show \" homicide : life on the street , \" gives a nice supporting turn as frank\\'s best friend and future colleague of john . \\nhe has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while frank\\'s world series predictions come true before his very eyes . \\nbraugher strikes the perfect facial expression here , simultaneously dismayed and amused . \\nperhaps the only thing i didn\\'t like about \" frequency \" is the overly sentimental coda , during which the camera\\'s focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard . \\nbut that\\'s only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics . \\ni freely acknowledge that \" frequency \" may best work as a \" guy \" movie , since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of \" field of dreams \" can be easily heard ) , but the underlying concept is universally applicable . \\nwho wouldn\\'t want to speak with a long-dead parent ? \\nor see how their children turn out ? \\n \" tell me about your life , son \" -- excuse me while i mist up . \\nand don\\'t call me a sissy . \\n',\n",

\\nlet me first say that religions of this nature , in the ideal , take the place of sex . \\nconsider the catholic church , which in its hey-dey , took religion as seriously as any other religion or institution ever . \\ngod takes the place of sex as manifested in all those vows of celibacy taken by the pope , cardinals , bishops , monks , etc . they forego the one , in order to come closer to the other . \\nduring the middle ages , when this doctrine was unmitigated and unchallenged , the most repressive regime the west has ever known in terms of scope and magnitude rose to power . \\n ( parenthetically , witness plato as well . \\nin the republic , he attempted to launch the first systematic absolutist regime . \\nnot coincidentally he was something of a mystic himself , regularly assailing the passions . ) \\ncatholicism , as policy , attacks the passions as evil . \\nit sees intercourse only as a means to perpetuate the species not as a way to pleasure . \\nmasturbation is considered a sin with the sacrament of penance necessary for absolution . \\nthis is religion , this is authoritarianism in its essence . \\nas further evidence , the nazis had the same attitudes as the church on these matters . \\nour culture , most of the cultures of the world have been steeped in this tradition for thousands of years . \\nwe can\\'t help but adopt , even internalize some of these same authoritarian attitudes , leading to a destructive split between the biological and social self . \\nmickey and mallory knox internalized them , too , then through spontaneous sexual awareness sparked in each one of them by the presence of the other , discovered them , and began expurgating them from themselves and from the world in the process unifying themselves . \\nit is a straightforward liberation through sex . \\nas some good patriarch once observed , \" you can maintain control as long as everyone keeps their clothes on . \" \\nm&m had a vision of what the world would be like without contradictions . \\nthey saw what civilization and culture and everyday life would be like under such conditions . \\n \" the moment of realization is worth a thousand prayers , \" as mickey says . \\nas a the most consistent and impassioned critic of western culture there is nietzsche applying his typical stridency to the matter : let us look each other in the face . \\nwe are hyberboreans--we know well enough how remote our place is . \\n \" neither by land nor by water will you find the road to the hyberboreans \" : even pindar , in his day , knew that much about us . \\nbeyond the north , beyond ice , beyond death--our life , our happiness . . . . \\nwe have discovered that happiness ; we know the way ; we got our knowledge of it from thousands of years in the labyrinth . \\nwho else has found it ? --the \\nman of today ? -- \" i \\ndon\\'t know either the way out or the way in ; i am whatever doesn\\'t know either the way out or the way in \" --so sighs the man of today . . . . \\nthis is the sort of modernity that made us ill--we sickened in lazy peace , cowardly compromise , the whole virtuous dirtiness of the modern yea and nay . \\nthis tolerance and largeur of the heart that \" forgives \" everything because it \" understands \" everything is a sirocco to us . \\nrather live amid the ice than among modern virtues and other such south-winds ! \\nas far as i can tell , this is what the movie has to say . \\nits alleged critique of the media is only secondary , tertiary , quaternary , subsidiary for sure . \\nfor example wayne gayle\\'s first report ends with some gen x dude saying , \" if i were a mass murderer i\\'d be mickey and mallory , \" in his most excellent bill and ted voice . \\non one level you cd make the humdrum observation that because the media had glamorized these two psychopaths that the uncritical , impressionable gen x dumb guy confused the matter and took them for heroes . \\nit seems more likely that he made an independent judgement at a subconscious level recognizing what m&m were up to and confessing that if he had the balls to be so honest with himself he\\'d be just like them , killing and destroying what deserves it . \\nlet me exemplify what i\\'ve been saying by analyzing a scene from the film , namely the scene where mallory fucks the gas station attendant , kills him , and then castigates him for giving her \" the worst fuckin\\' head i\\'ve ever had in my life ! ! ! \" \\nnow , i never claimed that mickey and mallory had a perfect relationship , because demonstrably they didn\\'t , and this scene and the ones leading up to it show us this . \\nsometimes they are the source of each others frustrations , but unwilling to kill each other , since they love each other so much and are responsible for each others liberation , they must kill in place of their lever . \\nit\\'s no secret that in this scene mallory fantasized that her victim was mickey . \\nas the attendant approached he took on mickey\\'s character in the eyes of mallory . \\nshe needed to kill him because of he kidnapped that girl in the hotel room and was having secret fantasies about her while making love to mallory . \\nupon discovery , mallory views this as a betrayal , judges him , and commutes his sentence on someone else . \\nthe style of the movie is a whole \\'nother matter that i won\\'t get into very deeply but surely it is partially responsible for its power . \\nlet me just say that its editing has the opposite effect of a western with shots that linger forever on a salon entrance or the like suggesting the expansiveness , barreness and boredom of the frontier lifestyle . \\nthe rapid succession of all those 8mm , 16mm , 35mm images from various perspectives with a soundtrack sometimes in sync and sometimes out of sink instills a skittish , frenetic mood . \\nalso , jungian archetypes abound . \\nthese can\\'t help but trigger deep psychological responses we can barely understand especially when they flash across the screen for barely a few frames . \\nsome of the best scenes and lines that come to mind .

\" \\nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \\nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \\nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don\\'t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don\\'t , love each other anymore . \\nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \\nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn\\'t mind doing things differently than they were planned . \\nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \\nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \\nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \\nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character\\'s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \\nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson\\'s films , stepmom . \\nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \\nif it wasn\\'t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year\\'s best picture . \\nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer\\'s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \\nalthough i wouldn\\'t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film\\'s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \\nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ? \\npfeiffer\\'s performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong , as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion , you wonder how , how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism . \\npfeiffer\\'s performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring , will be in the heart\\'s of any viewer that has watched this moving film . \\nthe story of us is one of 1999\\'s most real , yet funny films , as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked . \\nsuperb acting , direction , writing , story , and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film , which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman , make the story of us a touching , unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall . \\nthe film\\'s major high points are the fights between ben and katie , as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed , and although they also say things like \" it\\'s over , \" or \" i hate you , \" you can tell the two still share a deep connection , and that inside , somewhere , they are still an \" us . \" \\nthe bottom line : a wonderful , enchanting , and heartbreaking film . \\none of the most realistic , heartbreaking films in recent years . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" i know what you did last summer , \" the first high-profile slasher thriller to be released after 1996\\'s \" scream , \" and written by the same screenwriter , kevin williamson , is a stylish , effective horror film that became 1997\\'s biggest hit of the fall season . \\nwhile \" scream \" was a more knowing film about the genre , \" i know what you did last summer \" is more reminiscent of a straight-forward slasher flick , but it is far more intelligent than such bottom-of-the-barrel guilty pleasures as all nine of the \" friday the 13th \" films ( well , okay , \" jason goes to hell \" was pure hell to sit through ) . \\nthe film starts off with four talented , aspiring teenage friends who have just graduated from high school in their small boating town of southport , n . c . \\nit is the 4th of july , and they will soon be heading their separate ways . \\nkind-hearted julie ( jennifer love hewitt ) , and outsider ray ( freddie prinze jr . ) will be headed off to college , while helen ( sarah michelle gellar ) , who has just been honored croaker queen in the town , and her ignorant jock boyfriend , barry ( ryan phillippe ) , are going to new york to become an actress and football player . \\nwhen the four of them travel to a nearby mountain-side beach for the evening , they are dismayed after hitting a man in the road on their way home . \\ndistraught and confused , they decide they can\\'t go to the police because they will be charged with manslaughter , so they devise a plan to throw the apparently dead victim off a peer into the ocean , in hopes no one will find him . \\njulie is apprehensive about it , but is forced into it by barry . \\nswitch to exactly a year later , julie , still unable to come to terms with what she did , reluctantly returns home from college to find that all three of her old friends are still in the town because their career plans did not work out . \\nalmost immediately , julie recieves an ominous letter that simply reads , \" i know what you did last summer , \" and that is the start of their problems as they find themselves being terrorized by a mysterious figure dressed in fisherman gear and yielding a giant hook . \\n \" i know what you did last summer , \" is a successful horror film for a number of reasons . \\nthe cinematography by denis crossan could very well be described as hitchcockian , as it put shadows , fog , steam , and other clever devices to add atmosphere to the proceedings . \\nthe characters , particularly julie and helen , are realistically written , and the film amazingly deals with their broken relationship in a few scenes , which is largely uncharacteristic in films of this sort . \\nand last , the film creates a few dazzling and scary set-pieces that are some of the most memorable i\\'ve seen in a horror movie , particularly the suspenseful , superbly shot sequence involving helen at her family\\'s store with the killer inside with her . \\nperhaps the best character is that of missy egan ( anne heche ) , a lonely backwoods woman whose brother was the one julie thinks they hit . \\nheche\\'s performance is a standout , as she is able to create a full character in only about ten minutes of screen time . \\n \" i know what you did last summer , \" could have been a great horror movie if not for a few problems . \\nprinze jr . gives a performance to be desired here , and much of his dialogue sounds wooden coming out of his mouth . \\nalso , the climax of the film almost completely loses its frightening grip after it unveils the mystery killer , who is a decidedly bad actor and should not have been given any lines . \\nluckily , the penultimate scene saves the disappointing finale , which includes an expertly crafted \" jump-in-your-seat \" scare . \\nin the main roles , hewitt and gellar are highly talented , and hewitt , especially , is one of the best screamers i\\'ve ever heard . \\nshe honestly could give jamie lee curtis a little competition for the best \" scream queen . \" \\nand gellar is touching as a young woman who , in the course of one year , finds her dream of being an actress ultimately shattered . \\nalthough not up to the level of either \" scream \" movies , or the more recent , \" urban legend , \" \" i know what you did last summer \" is a respectable , smartly-scripted slasher film that firmly proved good horror movies were once again being made . \\n',\n",

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nthe teaser trailers for my best friend\\'s wedding scarsely gave reason for hope - it looked like the sort of goofy , light-hearted comedy than might put julia roberts back in the limelight , but little more ; i\\'d frankly rarely seen a trailer place such an emphasis on people falling over for laughs so often . \\nit was then to both my surprise and my delight to find that my best friend\\'s wedding was such a success - a strong , bouyant romantic-comedy with some decidedly unconventionally quirky comic aspects , featuring a triumphant performance from ms . roberts . \\nthe heroine of my best friend\\'s wedding is julianne potter ( julia roberts ) , a successful new york restaurant critic , and we open the film with a whimsical revelation to her editor george downes ( rupert everett ) that years ago , she had made a pact with her dear best friend and ex-lover michael o\\'neal ( dermot mulroney ) , a sports writer , that if they both hadn\\'t married by the time they reached 28 , they had promised to marry each other . \\nboth julianne and michael are both single , of course , and when george inquires about michael\\'s age , julianne realizes that he\\'s mere weeks away from his 28th birthday , and is quite distressed when she receives a phone call from michael later that day . \\nhowever , she finds herself even more distraught when michael\\'s call is in regards to his impending marriage to heiress kimmy wallace ( cameron diaz ) , and when he asks julianne to fly down to chicago for the wedding , julianne suddenly realizes that she loves michael , and resolves to break up the wedding and steal the groom by any means necessary . \\nthe setup for my best friend\\'s wedding , then , is a fairly conventional one , and in many ways the film\\'s storyline is formulaic - but only to a certain extent : the film was directed by p . j . hogan , whose first feature , muriel\\'s wedding , had quite an offbeat tone for a traditional uplifting ugly-duckling story , and the same holds true for my best friend\\'s wedding , which confidently combines traditional romantic-comedy elements with a really eccentric sense of humour . \\nthe film is innundated with sly mischievousness which seems clearly the influence of mr . hogan . \\nfor example , there\\'s a heartfelt , emotional exchange between julianne and michael late in the film - with a trio of teenagers , inhaling helium and sounding every bit like alvin and the chipmunks , harmonizing in the background . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding opens with an inspired opening credit sequence which sets the tone for the film , and there are scenes where actors spontaneously burst into song to good comic effect - it could almost be argued that this film is nearly as much of a musical as woody allen\\'s everyone says i love you ; i\\'d even assert it\\'s a more successful one . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding keeps breaking conventionality with its characters as well . \\nin a typical romantic-comedy , kimmy would be portrayed as a snooty , conniving ice queen , and the audience would be cheering for julianne to rescue michael from her grasps ; this film is smarter than that - here , kimmy is sweet , sincere , and innocent ; julianne even admits at one point that had she not resolved to utterly destroy kimmy\\'s life , she\\'d actually like her too . \\nthe george character is almost a staple of recent film - the homosexual male friend of the heroine who acts as a confidant and provides the guiding voice of reason - but in my best friend\\'s wedding , he gets to have a playful , mischievous and charming personality . \\nthroughout the film , the formulaisms one often sees is romantic-comedy are given little twists , and the result is a film which is compelling all the way to its somewhat unorthodox conclusion . \\nthere is a lot of smart writing in the well-paced screenplay by ronald bass ; we\\'re given four interesting , vivid , and likeable characters , with some good dialogue and some genuinely charming and touching moments . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a strong career rebound for julia roberts , who turns in a top-notch , confident and reassured performance as julianne . \\nthis isn\\'t the sort of role one usually associates with ms . roberts - the julianne character\\'s neurotic , fumbling characteristics are more in line with a meg ryan role - but ms . roberts works wonderfully in the film and demonstrates her aptitude at comedy here , remaining compelling and empathetic to the audience , if not entirely sympathetic , even when her deeds done to destroy the wedding plans of her best friend are less than honourable . \\neven better than ms . roberts though is cameron diaz , who turns in a shining performance in my best friend\\'s weddding . \\nwith a smile which lights up the screen , she effectively conveys kimmy\\'s insecurity and utter sweetness in an endearing manner , and never hits a false note in the film . \\nshe even sings - i won\\'t soon forget her charming serenade of \" i just don\\'t know what to do with myself \" . \\nrupert everett is given a very juicy role as george , and he makes the most of it with a hilarious turn which makes his character perhaps the most vivid and most memorable in the film . \\nhis george is a bit of a devilish rogue , entirely affable , and mr . everett\\'s performance is a delight to watch ; he\\'s clearly having fun , and his joy is infectuous . \\ndermot mulroney is adequate in a thankless role - unlike the other characters in the film , he\\'s not given a lot to do , but there is a genuine onscreen chemistry between ms . roberts and mr . mulroney , and consequently the longstanding friendship between his michael character and the julianne character always seemed completely authentic . \\nwhen julia roberts\\' lustre began to fade , and she was usurped from her title as \" america\\'s sweetheart \" by sandra bullock , i thought it was a canny career move on her part to take supporting roles in prestige projects like michael collins and everyone says i love you to raise her profile . \\nwhile that didn\\'t quite work out , it\\'s near-certain that her successful return to the genre which made her a big star back in 1990 , the romantic-comedy , will once again raise her ante in the hollywood game . \\nmy best friend\\'s wedding marks a return to form for ms . roberts , and cements p . j . hogan\\'s reputation as a skilled director of comedy . \\n',\n",

       " b'for about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer , hard boiled , face off ) appears to have made an exciting , elegant , charming spy thriller , kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them . \\nsadly , as the picture progresses , the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up , two-hour long episode of magyuver . \\nand not a particularly good one at that . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\nmi2 begins flashily enough , that initial flash leading us to believe that it\\'ll soon give way to something of a plot , but it only gives way to more flash , then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruise\\'s firing gun just so they can die really cool . \\nearly on , during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton ) , woo works some of his trademark magic . \\nin one hypnotic , though completely inexplicable sequence , the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and other\\'s eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance , coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff . \\nprior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain , sans scaffolding , then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another . \\nwhy ? \\ni haven\\'t the foggiest . \\ni doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply . \\nwith mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine , the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects . \\nit\\'s possible that these \" spies \" could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off , though of course this is never explored . \\nthe scenes i\\'ve described are really only included to titillate , not to give any insight into character . \\ngod forbid . \\nwoo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic , but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals . \\nstill in terms of crackerjack eye candy , the opening has much to cherish . \\ncruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) . \\nbetween the frantic dancing , woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact . \\nthe scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way , yet it has style and something of soul , and woo casts a bit of a spell on us . \\nsure it\\'s all smoke and mirrors , but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product . \\nthandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene that\\'s about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \\\\ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight . \\nthey flirt and exchange obvious double entendres . \\nnewton bats her eyes flirtatiously . \\ncruise grins a little too slyly . \\nthe cruise character , ethan hunt , has been drastically altered since the first film . \\nhere cruise plays him more as a hip , sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 . \\nhe\\'s cool and dashing , which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film ) , and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90\\'s ) . \\nsadly as the film progresses we see less of cruise\\'s initial \" i\\'m the man ! \" \\ncharm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug . \\nmi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act , which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just won\\'t stop . \\nthe whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film ) , which really should be unheard of in a john woo film , but alas this particular battle could\\'ve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the \" symbolic \" pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) . \\nwe\\'ve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand . \\nit isn\\'t done any differently here . \\nthe action is pure hard target \\\\ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind . \\nhe\\'s cool for sure but he\\'s made to be as empty as the movie . \\nthe actor isn\\'t used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment , be it during a gunfight , before one or after one . \\nwhen he\\'s not beaming away , he\\'s staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell , but woo\\'s editing seriously undermines the effort . \\nhe fetishizes cruise\\'s angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof . \\ni half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that he\\'s really austin powers . \\nin a classic woo action moment , ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death . \\nthe gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise , basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) . \\nthe lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles . \\nthough instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment , the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug , only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position ) , land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a \" so you thought i was dead . . . \" . \\nnot to worry , cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat . \\nwhat a hero ! \\nyou may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2\\'s plot . \\nmy reasoning is simple : i\\'m not sure of any good it would do . \\nthe film itself has absolutely no concern with story , only with hurtling forth to the next \" special \" effect . \\ni wasn\\'t kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video . \\nnobody will go to this for the plot , and if they do they\\'ll surely regret it . \\nas summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing . \\nin mi , the plot seemed to be built around brian de palma\\'s ( that film\\'s director ) stylistic flourishes , while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woo\\'s non-stop masturbatory pandemonium . \\nit\\'s irrelevant in every sense , as is character . \\nall that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors . \\n',\n",
       " b'it seemed like the perfect concept . \\nwhat better for the farrelly brothers , famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter , than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ? \\nit\\'s exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness ) , throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh . \\njim carrey\\'s signed on too ? \\neven better . \\nthe national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers\\' new film before its opening , claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality , labeling it incorrectly as \" schizophrenia , \" and so forth . \\nsuch a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would , of course , only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers\\' fire , proving that some people just couldn\\'t take a joke , and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy . \\nyes , it all seemed perfect , but one thing went wrong : their movie isn\\'t funny . \\nit\\'s not for lack of trying . \\nthe farrellys utilize in \" me , myself & irene \" their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites , a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver , decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them . \\nthis , of course , means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature , making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult . \\nsoon enough , charlie\\'s repressed aggression manifests itself into a second , independent personality named hank , a deep-voiced , boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster . \\nthis guy isn\\'t above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which he\\'s been insulted , or holding a little girl\\'s head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street . \\nthen things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted , and the film runs off its tracks . \\nsome have suggested that this isn\\'t a problem , because the farrelly brothers\\' brand of humor doesn\\'t require plot to work . \\nthey\\'re wrong , of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys\\' last effort , 1996\\'s \" there\\'s something about mary . \" \\n ( 1999\\'s \" outside providence \" was technically an earlier project . ) \\nthe brothers\\' earlier film wasn\\'t funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe ) , but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected . \\nin \" mary , \" the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : they\\'d have you thinking the story was going one way , then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion . \\n \" me , myself & irene , \" by contrast , seems to have been made by folks who looked at \" mary \" and saw only the surface grossness , missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work . \\nhaving been produced by the same guys who made \" mary , \" \" irene \" seems like an even bigger disappointment . \\nthe brothers pile on the offensive humor , taking shots at race , midgets , albinos , mental illness , and all manner of bathroom jokes . \\nbut they haven\\'t come up with a way to make any of it fresh ; most of \" me , myself & irene \" comes off as rote , by-the-numbers , adolescent comedy . \\nthe plot , with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger ) , who\\'s in more trouble than anyone knows , back to new york , has an ending that\\'s entirely predictable from the get-go . \\n ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ? \\nyeah , me too . ) \\nthe farrellys then introduce scores of different characters , and none of them ever manage to do anything you haven\\'t already expected them to do , no matter how outrageous their actions might be . \\ncompared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing , this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed , presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value , it\\'s no longer funny , merely gross . \\nthe jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry . \\ntake , for example , the subplot involving charlie\\'s three black sons ( anthony anderson , mongo brownlee , jerod mixon ) . \\nthe incongruity of it all is funny for a while , with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face . \\nbut by the end of the film , they\\'re still doing the same schitck ; it hasn\\'t been elevated to another , funnier level , and it hasn\\'t been dropped either . \\nthat\\'s too bad , because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through . \\n \" me , myself & irene \" reeks of wasted opportunities . \\nthere ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlie\\'s new personality , and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hank\\'s actions . \\nthis doesn\\'t really happen ; nearly every supporting character learns about charlie\\'s condition early on , so they don\\'t have any opportunity to be surprised by it . \\nthe film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called , appropriately , \" whitey \" ) , but the script doesn\\'t go anywhere with it , instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax . \\njim carrey is a gifted comedian , both physically and vocally , but he\\'s left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in \" all of me . \" \\nit\\'s a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting , but none of it is terribly funny . \\ncarrey doesn\\'t pull any stunts we don\\'t expect him to pull , and the farrellys\\' script doesn\\'t give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting aren\\'t set up in any meaningful way . \\nperhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better . \\nzellweger\\'s irene is not a strong female lead ; mary in \" mary \" may have been part adolescent fantasy , but she was also intelligent and strong-willed . \\nirene is nothing in particular , as the film never makes clear whether she\\'s ditzy , clever , or neither . \\nas such , she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only \" sane \" person in the film . \\nchris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent , and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this . \\nhe , like the others , does absolutely nothing unexpected . \\nafter viewing the shapeless mess that \" me , myself & irene \" eventually dissolved into , i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves . \\nmaybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked . \\nbut i don\\'t believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style . \\nif the farrellys are indeed good , smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are ) , they\\'ll rebound just fine . \\neven after that happens , though , i\\'ll still consider \" me , myself & irene \" to be a high-caliber misfire . \\n',\n",

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\n \" all the world\\'s a stage and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances and one man in his time plays many parts \" - excerpt from as you like it , act ii , scene 7 \\nwhen william shakespeare penned this passage , he could not have possibly envisioned a world in which the domestic activites in an abode would be broadcast across the continent , or where women would install webcams in their apartments in order to convert voyeurism into cash . \\nthis is the world of today , and it is the perfect climate to unveil a prototypical high-concept project like the truman show . \\ntruman burbank ( jim carrey ) seems to have the perfect life . \\nhe has a pretty , doting wife meryl ( laura linney ) , a comfortable insurance sales position , an immaculate suburban home in the idyllic island community of seahaven , a reliable childhood buddy marlon ( noah emmerich ) -- except for the dog that paws a greeting to him every morning and his hydrophobia , this is paradise . \\nor so it would seem . \\nbizarre , inexplicable incidents begin to crop up in truman\\'s life . \\na lighting fixture unexpectedly plummets from the sky . \\na rainstorm which gives new meaning to the term \\'isolated\\' follows him around . \\na radio broadcast appears to be describing his every move . \\nfor the first time in his life , it is beginning to dawn on truman that things are not what they appear to be . \\nthe truman show , directed by peter weir and written by andrew niccol , is a remarkably well-constructed film , paced perfectly with every scene fluidly leading into the next . \\nbalancing drama with humour , thoughtfulness with abandon , this is a film which addresses an intriguing and intricate concept with just the right mixture of sermonizing and whimsical fancy . \\nin many ways , mr . niccol\\'s screenplay mirrors the spirit of his previous gattaca -- both films focus on the theme of triumph of the human spirit over oppressive adversity , with pivotal , character-defining moments occurring at sea . \\nalthough the film\\'s rather conventional climax doesn\\'t sustain the inspired dynamic achieved in the first two-thirds , and ultimately just falls short on delivering the intended emotional punch , there are moments through the truman show which are genuinely stirring and moving as truman attempts to make sense of his unraveling world and grasp the implications behind his discoveries of deception . \\ndespite the multitude of pertinent issues being broached by the film , it remains foremost a finely-crafted piece of entertainment , constantly light and accessible . \\nthe tone achieved is far too sunny for any sense of fearful paranoia to legitimately intrude , and as the carefully-stacked seahaven house of cards tumbles down , the film eschews any psychological ramifications for a man discovering that the fundamentals of his entire existence have been false . \\nthe end act of the truman show essentially boils down to a rehash of the reliable , crowdpleasing underdog vs . \\nthe system formula . \\nwhile the film is an impressive realisation of an inspired concept , some elements are lacking . \\nthe device of mysterious lauren/sylvia ( natascha mcelhone ) as a contributing impetus to truman\\'s growing awareness isn\\'t exactly convincing . \\nthere\\'s not much of a discernable spark between either the two characters or the actors themselves , and the scenes in which she indignantly confronts the megalomaniac christoff ( ed harris ) with regards to the moral ambiguity of his actions unnecessarily spells things out for the audience , thankfully avoided elsewhere in the film . \\nin fact , although the film smartly restricts the number of scenes depicting the real world outside truman\\'s artificial utopia to a mere handful of select reaction shots from enraptured gazers , it might have perhaps been even more indicting and damning to immerse itself even * more * deeply in the insulatory seahaven world , with the resultant effect that the repercussions felt as the film finally shifts outside the imposed bubble are all the more startling . \\nstill , the scathing commentary issued by this film is on target , and its insidiously oblique manner of delivery is far more effective in conveying the message than the more forthright anti-voyeuristic tirades such as that of the recent costa gavras film mad city . \\ni\\'ve always believed that the versatile ms . linney possesses a tremendous comic gift -- she has always seems to have a impish gleam in her eyes -- and in the truman show she runs rampant with her duplicitous character , mischievously flashing a glazed , insanely jovial grin as she perkily recites impromptu product placement slogans . \\ncheerfully going over the top , it\\'s hilarious to watch her -- who would have ever guessed that she\\'d have the opportunity to outshine the reigning king of comedy in the laughs department of a film ? \\nms . linney is a delight in the film . \\nbut it is mr . carrey who rules the show here . \\nhe may not have been intuitively the most obvious choice to portray underdog hero truman burbank -- the role is seriously lacking in any of the frenetic comic interludes which typify his traditional parts -- but he brings to the character tremendous energy and eminent appeal : it\\'s difficult not to root for truman . \\nin a commanding performance , mr . carrey lends our protagonist an inherent sense of decency and integrity which makes him a genuinely engaging presence , and acquits himself impressively in this dramatic turn , demonstrating admirable restraint -- there\\'s an early scene where he\\'s down on his knees gardening , and given his past track record , one almost instinctively anticipates mr . carrey to pull one of more infamous , and in this case , wholly inappropriate sight gags . \\nit\\'s almost poetic how this notorious look-at-me actor successfully tones it down to play a character who\\'s constantly the centre of attention . \\nin addition to the fine performances by the bulk of the cast -- mr . emmerich is particularly noteworthy for issuing his character a sense of sturdy trustworthiness -- the film is immeasurably aided by wonderful production design by dennis gassner in creating truman\\'s antiseptic , white picket-fenced smalltown utopia , and by burkhard dallwitz\\'s original score . \\ntechnical credits are first-rate all around . \\nwhile the truman show is clearly a definitive high-concept film , it\\'s not exactly a dazzlingly innovative one -- obvious predecessors utilising common elements abound , ranging from 1965\\'s secret agent through to the groundbreaking british 1967 tv series the prisoner . \\nall the same , this is a visionary , award-calibre film : entertaining , provocative , and intelligent . \\nthe curious ( and possibly disturbing ) thing may be that although upon first glance the plausibility of the film\\'s concept seems unfathomably outrageous , it\\'s abundantly clear that our society is rapidly approaching , if not actualisation , at least permissiveness of such a scenario . \\nperhaps the highest compliment which can be paid to mr . weir is that his depiction of this bizarro state is so convincing that we accept it without question . \\nperhaps we recognize a bit of ourselves in this world . \\n',\n",

       " b'anna and the king is at least the fourth film adaptation of margaret landon\\'s fact based novel the king and i , and it\\'s big , expensive and soulless . \\nthough good-looking , its lavish sets , fancy costumes and luscious cinematography can do little to compensate for the emotional wasteland that is peter krikes and steve meerson\\'s script . \\nso much money was spent on pretty pictures that they forgot to actually make the movie interesting . \\nthis is jodie foster\\'s first movie since the jaw-droppingly brilliant contact came out more than two years ago and it isn\\'t the best choice to show off her acting chops . \\nshe\\'s trapped in the stoic role of anna leonowens , the uptight , widowed british schoolteacher who comes to siam ( now thailand ) with her son to instruct the king\\'s ( chow yun-fat ) son in the ways of the west ( because \" the ways of england are the ways of the world ) . \\nthe king likes her so much he puts her in charge of educating the whole royal family ( 58 kids with 10 more in the way ; impressive , no ? ) . \\nthe eldest prince is none too happy about this ( \" father , have i offended you in some way ? \\nwhy do you punish me with imperialist schoolteacher ? ) , but soon gets to know anna and her stern- mother-who-loves-you personality better and comes to like her . \\nmeanwhile , siam comes under attack from the neighboring british colony of burma . \\nthe king and his close advisors suspect that this is britain\\'s doing which arouses suspicion in siam , putting anna in an uncomfortable position . \\nshe is not sure what to make of this and seems to herself suspect british involvement in the crisis but works to diffuse the king\\'s prejudices . \\nhe , though self-righteous as ever , can\\'t help but be influenced by the eloquent anna and they slowly , quietly , develop affections for each other . \\nthere is a scene in the middle of anna and the king where one of the king\\'s younger daughters dies . \\nit\\'s your classic deathbed scene , with the girl\\'s mournful eyes staring at her father , who tries only semi- successfully to maintain his composure . \\nanna then comes in and cries a bit . \\nthe sequence was there for a purpose : to evoke a strong emotional response from the viewer . \\ni\\'m usually a sucker for such scenes and yet this time , i was just sitting there , my emotions untouched . \\nthis remains true through all of the movie which remains emotionally barren . \\nwe never develop connections to the characters ; never given a reason to care . \\nthis ludicrously long epic was directed by andy tennant , whose last film was ever after , one of my favorites of 1998 . \\ni do not doubt tennant\\'s ability to put together a decent movie , but anna and the king , aside from being psychologically inept is also technologically deficient . \\nthe sets and scenery are gorgeous , but the camerawork does nothing to convey its grandeur . \\neven terrence malick managed to do more with flora and fauna in his otherwise abysmal the thin red line than tennant can muster from $75 million worth of props and a shoot in malaysia . \\nwe feel like the camera is restricted to its immediate point of view ; there are no wide tracking shots or sweeping zooms to fill us with larger-than-life awe . \\ni liked both foster and yun-fat , who give entertaining if not terribly involving performances in the two lead roles . \\nfoster\\'s generally stoic persona serves her well here , as she is playing a reserved , formal and rather underdeveloped character . \\nyun-fat is especially effective , perfectly conveying the king of siam\\'s sangfroid permeated with violent outbursts . \\nwhat does anna and the king in is its inability to involve the viewer in its characters and situations . \\nthe cast is great , the director is talented , and the budget is lavish , but this ill-advised remake of the classic rogers and hammerstein movie is unable to utilize any of those things to form a compelling whole . \\nthis is an emotionless costume epic . \\n',\n",

       " b'shakespeare . you hardly understood it in high school . \\nwhy would you want more of it now that your english grade doesn\\'t count on it ? \\nif this is your attitude , then i\\'ll say right off the bat that kenneth branagh\\'s hamlet is probably not for you , and you might as well stop reading right now . \\nif , however , you are a lover of the bard , or at the very least are open-minded about a challenging script , read on , for there is something rotten in the state of denmark . \\nnamely , the king has died , and his widow the queen has wed the king\\'s brother , claudius , but prince hamlet suspects foul play . \\nhis suspicions are confirmed when the ghost of his father appears and relates the story of his murder at his own brother\\'s hands . \\nhamlet , enlisting the help of his friend horatio , conspires to capture the conscience of the new king to expose his treachery . . . . and \\nthe game is afoot . . . . \\nthe first things you notice about this production are the sets and costumes . \\nwith external scenes filmed at blemheim palace in england ( also the one of the sites for the recent the avengers ) , the grandiose quality of the setting is immediately established . \\ninterior scenes are similarly graced with intricate and flamboyant rooms and chambers . \\nthe hamlet castle\\'s grand throne room is an impressive piece of work incorporating high ceilings , mirror-panel doors , and bridges which connect opposite sides of a second-story loft . \\ncostuming is equally grand , drawing upon both history and imagination . . \\nnot quite the denmark of the 1600\\'s , the characters\\' attire is something of a cross between that era and turn of the century russia , very effectively giving the film more of a timeless feel . \\nit is not surprising that tim harvey and alexandra byrne were nominated for best art direction and best costume design oscars , respectively . \\nin addition to directing , kenneth branagh also plays the title character . \\nas the revenge-driven royal heir , branagh provides a riveting performance of emotional highs and lows . \\nfrom the anticipation of seeing his father\\'s ghost , to the melancholy of finding the burial site of his childhood jester , to his eventual wrath , branagh delivers in spades . \\nevery scene truly revolves around hamlet , as much a tribute to branagh\\'s acting and directing as to shakespeare\\'s manuscript . \\nhamlet seems to be a who\\'s who of shakespearean-trained actors , so watching them perform the craft for which they have much love is a delight in itself . \\njulie christie , as hamlet\\'s mother gertrude , and derek jacobi as his murderous uncle claudius both fill the classic roles superbly , as do many of the supporting players . \\nkate winslet as hamlet\\'s lover ophelia , does an outstanding job demonstrating the character\\'s plummet to the depths of dispair and madness . \\nrichard briers as ophelia\\'s father , polonius , and michael moloney as her brother , laertes , are equally convincing . \\nnicholas farrell as hamlet\\'s trusted friend horatio , and timothy spall and reece dinsdale as the two-timing rosencrantz and guildenstern round out the excellent core cast . \\nhamlet also seems to be a film in which someone tried to stuff as many well known actors as possible . \\nin some cases , this made for interesting scenes . \\nbilly crystal is surprisingly good as the gravedigger who unearths the skull of yorick , whom hamlet knew quite well . \\ncrystal proves himself able to deliver the lines with both the timing of a classic actor and the verbal countenance of a comedian , and the result is a very funny scene . \\nhowever , charleton heston , whom many might think would butcher shakespeare , is the biggest surprise of all . \\nas the player king , the leader of a troupe of traveling actors , he is absolutely breathtaking when narrating the story of priam and hecuba . \\npart of his monologue is overlaid with a visual enactment of the story ( with sir john gielgud and judi dench ) , but this is most unfortunate , for it robs heston of some of the attention which he deserves at this time . \\nhis off-camera speaking , while gripping , sort of downplays the scene to a narration done by any other well-voiced actor . \\ni wish branagh had chosen to allow us to envision in our own minds the scene which heston lays out , and let the venerable actor have the attention . \\nunfortunately , there were some casting choices which led to poor distractions . \\njack lemmon , an excellent actor , just can\\'t do shakespeare . \\nas marcellus , the guard who sees the elder hamlet\\'s ghost , lemmon sadly underperforms and is shown up left and right by those around him . \\ngerard depardieu , another talented actor , is wasted when given little more than the utterances of \" yes , my lord \" and \" no , my lord \" in the role of reynaldo . \\nrichard attenborough has a ( literally ) walk-on role , showing up at the eleventh hour as the english ambassador . \\ni think he had two lines . \\nthen there is rufus sewell as fortinbras of norway . \\nwhen i went to see dangerous beauty earlier this year , two ladies behind me kept commenting about how handsome he was . \\nif bulging eyes are your idea of handsome , well i guess comic actor marty feldman was some kind of sex symbol to you . \\nhamlet is a complicated tale of treachery and revenge in which triumph and defeat become one . \\nbranagh attempts to help us out with some of the intricacies by visually representing some of the more elusive stretches of dialogue by presenting them as flashback-type images . \\nthis only works about half the time , and i wonder if it would have been just as well to do without them . \\nyou don\\'t have to be some kind of genius to appreciate shakespeare , but it is quite difficult to understand unless you have the time to read or hear it carefully and repeatedly . \\nthe alternate method of comprehension is that with which most of us are familiar , the high school english course . \\nin it , you are hopefully fortunate enough to have an educator willing to help you with the plot points and nuances essential to understanding a play written in the rigmarole known as the king\\'s english . \\nor i suppose you could just read the cliff notes .

       " b'when i was growing up in 1970s , boys in my school used to divide into two groups , based on their action movies preferences . \\nthe first one , myself included , liked movies that featured spectacular car chases , lots of machinegun fire and huge explosions . \\nthe latter one preferred hong kong martial arts flicks , probably because they could ( or , to be more precise , thought they could ) imitate its stunts in the real life . \\ndecades later , while refining my own cinematic taste , i began to appreciate and actually like those movies , probably because of overexposure to shoot-em-up idiocy of 1980s ramboids . \\nyes , most of the kung fu and other \" martial arts \" flicks were cheap , they had predictable and formulaic plot , and asked very little of production values aside from martial arts skills . \\nbut , in the same time , those movies had their own rules and in the hands of capable director could become a terrific guilty pleasure and source of relaxation . \\nthe best of those movies , one that passed the test of time and managed to keep its own cult status after quarter of century was enter the dragon . \\nmade in 1973 in a joint hong kong - hollywood venture , it was intended to bring bruce lee\\'s skills and kung fu philosophy to the western audience . \\nit succeeded , but it is still debatable whether by its own merit or by the unfortunate and mysterious death of bruce lee that immortalised the myth about that actor . \\nlee plays a quiet shaolin monk who is a martial arts expert . \\nhe is approached by interpol official who asks him to join tri-annual martial arts tournament that is held on a remote island , owned and controlled by han , renegade shaolin monk . \\ninterpol suspects that the martial arts business is just cover for narcotics , gun-running and prostitution operations and lee must find the evidence necessary for authorities to intervene . \\nlee accepts the mission because of personal reasons - o\\'harra , han\\'s brutal bodyguard was responsible for the tragic death of lee\\'s sister years ago . \\nthe island is also destination of two colourful martial arts experts from us - williams ( played by jim kelly ) is black activist running from the racist police , and his friend roper wants to make money in order to pay gambling debts . \\nthe plot of enter the dragon was in many ways influenced by james bond ( the 007 franchise itself would return favour by using kung fu elements in the man with the golden gun two years later ) . \\nthe main hero was faced against a power-hungry megalomaniac on a remote island , alone against whole army of bad guys . \\non the other hand , lee was more believable hero than bond ; deprived of guns and super-tech gadgets , he had to rely only on his personal skills in order to survive . \\nin the same time , the plot , although extremely thin , allowed him even some internal battles - between the natural instinct to avenge his sister and his own anti-violent philosophy . \\nthe latter provided some opportunities to evaluate lee\\'s acting skills and some new elements to his impressive screen presence . \\nalthough two other main actors - john saxon being the obligatory good white guy and jim kelly being the obligatory black good guy - were intended to share top spot with lee , they served as nothing more than a comic relief . \\nit is a real shame to see kelly , definitely the worse actor than saxon , to steal the scenes from him only because his lines , being the worst possible blaxploitation cliches , sound so damn over the top . \\nother actors , not including shih kien who turns han into typical , although not very convincing bondian villain , are nothing more than fist fodder for bruce lee ( among them is young jackie chan ) . \\nfighting scenes are still impressive today as they were 25 years ago , although they mostly lack gore associated with that genre . \\nin many way they are also more realistic ( they were personally staged by lee himself ) , demanding only a blow or two to incapacitate or kill the opponent . \\ni\\'m not a martial arts expert nor the martial arts fan , but comparing those scenes with typical scenes today i simply can\\'t avoid to appreciate the difference from today\\'s movie fights when masses of bloody pulp manage to get up from the floor and win in the end . \\nso , despite all the obvious flaws that preclude this movie of being top 100 of all times , enter the dragon is a incredibly entertaining piece of cinema and the martial arts flick that can be enjoyed even by those who don\\'t like that particular genre . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" love is the devil \" is a challenging film , munundating its audience with wild imagery and a plot structure that disallows a plot , perhaps in an attempt to get us to know the artist\\'s psyche rather than the artist\\'s lifeline . \\nwatching it , i was enthralled with the look of the film , the way the director shot everything like it was looking through a bizarre , personalized filter . \\neverything looks like it is not how life looks like but how painter francis bacon , the film\\'s subject , looked at it personally . \\nbut while i was engrossed , i stumbled upon my thoughts halfway through the film , awakened from my trance by some inner distraction , and began to try and follow what\\'s going on . \\nexactly what was i looking at ? \\nwatching this film , i wasn\\'t sure if it was the most insightful film i had ever seen or the most vacuous . \\ndirected ( and written ) by john maybury , \" love is the devil \" is stylish masterpiece for the senses . \\neverything looks originally bizarre and perplexing . \\nthe camera angles are ferociously askew , and the close-ups are uncomfortably too close . \\nthe editing is deft , occasionally cutting away to something bizarre every couple seconds , but other times holding on a shot for so long that you wonder if the audience is not supposed to be voyeurs , or rather , intruders to bacon\\'s world and psyche . \\nas such , there is no real story . \\ni\\'ve not heard much about francis bacon that i didn\\'t read prior to the film , but what i learned was this : he was a painter in england who reached his peak during the 60s and 70s , drawing hideously bizarre drawings of carnage and the like . \\nhe was one of the first to really come out of the closet , and in interviews , he was notoriously drunk yet incredibly witty . \\nas played by great shakesperean actor derek jacobi , he\\'s like a foppish and self-absorbed cross between oscar wilde and nero . \\nhe lives life the way he wants to live it , to the disatisfaction of those who have the privelege of being really close to him . \\nit\\'s as if he were taking delight in the destruction of others and maybe himself ( \" champagne for my real friends , and pain for my sham friends , \" he says one night at the bar he frequents ) . \\n \" love is the devil \" chronicles the latter part of his life . \\nbacon , well-known in his mid-life , awakens one night when he hears a man tumble through his ceiling window and land on the floor . \\nhe walks in , unafraid of what he finds , and discovers a thief , george dyer ( daniel craig ) . \\nbacon gives him an offer : if he spends the night with him , he can take anything he wants in the morning . \\ngeorge agrees to this , and off to bed he goes , but ends up staying with him , for whatever reason . \\nthe film shows their lives together , at least in reference to one another . \\nwhile creating bacon\\'s world of friends ( like \" high art , \" this film minors in showing a certain group of people who radiate a connection that is not shown but is understood ) , the film shows the relationship of bacon and george as it remains rather stagnant . \\nbacon is haughty and bizarre ; george is simple and doesn\\'t understand bacon in the least , especially not his paintings . \\nwhile watching this , that\\'s basically all i thought was there . \\nthe film has a hypnotic feel , free of any restraints of form , and is shot so uniquely that i felt my attention was almost entirely on the way this film was made rather than what it is about . \\nonce the film is over , it\\'s easier to piece it together . \\ni kept on thinking about this film , wondering what the point to all of it was . \\nsomeone doesn\\'t merely make a film of all style and no substance at all , and if they do , they do it by accident , but still allow some substance to creep in . \\nthinking about it , i remembered how the two fed off of eachother . \\ni thought about how bacon was a masochist , in love with cruelty ( in one scene , he watches a boxing match with a orgiastic delight , and lets out a squeal of pleasure when blood from the one boxer\\'s head splashes across his face ; in another scene , he masturbates to the odessa steps sequence of eisenstein\\'s \" battleship potemkin \" ) , and perhaps he drove george too far in his delight for pain . \\nhe drove him over the edge , and for him that was love , even if it wasn\\'t for george . \\ni guess that explains the title . \\na bit . \\nthat\\'s great and all , but i almost wish the film was devoid of any meaning . \\ni wish it hadn\\'t reduced itself to making some point about humanity , about how love is the most selfish thing in the world ( and it is , if you look at it a certain way ) . \\nor maybe if it had avoided any meaning about humanity and merely drove itself into being the one film that was truly inside one man\\'s twisted pysche . \\nit\\'s almost always best to obtain insights from looking at one man\\'s uniqueness than it is forcing universality down an audience\\'s throat . \\nthat way you don\\'t reduce your film to something it\\'s just not . \\ni can\\'t say i totally enjoyed \" love is the devil , \" though . \\ndespite all of the things i respect about this movie , it\\'s still rather uncomfortable to sit through . \\neven at a normally trite length of ninety minutes , the film still seems like an arduous task to sit through , especially after an exhausting first hour . \\nthough hypnotic , it still almost seems gimmicky and even redundant at times , as if it were taking advantage of one man\\'s truly bizarre nature but not doing anything deeper with it . \\nas such , i respect the way the film looks . \\nit\\'s beautiful and painstakingly crafted so that , along with \" what dreams may come \" and \" dark city , \" it\\'s the year\\'s most visually stunning film . \\nin fact , if a better script had been forged , i\\'d almost compare it in visual power to a peter greenaway film , complete with similar haunting images that stick in the mind forever . \\nand with a dymanite performance by derek jacobi , it has the comic and distanced tone that it needs . \\ni just wish it had been more than mostly style and just a hair bit of substance . \\nthen i would have had something to hold me over even now . \\n',\n",
       " b'mighty joe young blunders about for nearly twenty minutes before we actually get to see a great big gorilla . \\nhis entrance , however , is a grand one : out from the trees he leaps , gargantuan and imposing , sporting hands big enough to crush a volkswagen bug , and a pair of feet much larger than any pro basketball player will ever have . \\njoe bellows at the poachers before him , angry that they would like to kill him and sell him for millions of dollars . \\nduring this scene , i turned to my friend and said , \" wow . \\nthat\\'s some ape . \" \\njoe is quite a gorilla -- a big , digital gorilla . \\nhe runs around the fields , chasing cars and people . \\nhe picks things up and stares at them pensively . \\nhe breaks things on accident , because he\\'s just too big to avoid clumsiness . \\njoe , as a special effect , is an image that might hold your interest for five minutes . \\nas a character , he doesn\\'t quite register . \\nand the story he\\'s been put in is as limp as they come . \\nthe words \" family entertainment \" have never been a stamp of quality , but might joe young is just a silly special effects movie pretending to have a heart . \\nthe picture is a remake of the 1949 film . \\nit\\'s mostly just about the big gorilla , but , strictly as a formality , the movie also has a few human characters . \\nthe main one is jill young ( poor charlize theron , forced to waste her talent ) , a lover of gorillas . \\nas a child , she witnessed a group of poachers murder her mother ; now , she lives in the jungle to protect the wildlife . \\nspecifically , she\\'s out to protect joe , a giant gorilla who has been her friend since her childhood . \\nsoon , zoologist gregg o\\'hara ( bill paxton ) discovers joe ; he quickly realizes that poachers want to get joe and sell him to a big game hunter named strasser ( rade sherbedgia ) , who just happens to be the same guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\nso , in an effort to save joe , jill and gregg take the big gorilla to a preserve , where it is instantly clear that he is not safe from poachers . \\nin addition , the space is way too small for him ( after all , he is a really big gorilla ) . \\nand , to add to the complications , strasser shows up under a benevolent pretext ( he tells jill that he has a preserve big enough for joe ) , and joe recognizes strasser as the guy who killed jill\\'s mother . \\njill , of course , doesn\\'t recognize strasser , even though he did kill her mother . \\nthis is just one of the many examples of stupidity in mighty joe young , a film that fulfills every stereotype that comes with a special effects film . \\nthe movie isn\\'t really offensive -- it has some competent actors , a few nifty sets , and a lot of scenes with a big , digitized gorilla . \\nbut the story is really dumb , there aren\\'t any characters , and the film isn\\'t satisfying on any level beyond its visuals . \\nthe movie also has bad dialogue . \\nif a critic says that a film has bad dialogue , it\\'s only fair to quote some of it , but most of the words spoken in this picture are phrases like \" joe isn\\'t happy ! \" \\nand \" joe isn\\'t safe here ! \" \\n \" we need to get joe out of here ! \" \\n \" joe is way too big for that cage ! \" \\ni don\\'t know if these phrases are word for word , but they\\'re close . \\nas i said , the characters here are only present as a formality : they do little more than state the obvious ( of * course * joe is too big for that cage ) . \\npaxton and theron are talented performers who deserve to work on a script that provides characters for them . \\nsadly , mighty joe young wastes them both . \\nthere are a few clever moments ( although none of them are surfacing in my memory at the moment ) , and , as i said , the digital effects held my attention for at least five minutes . \\nit\\'s certainly not a bad film for kids ; i doubt joe will give them nightmares . \\nbut adults in the audience aren\\'t likely to find much of anything interesting about the big gorilla . \\na big gorilla is only interesting for a little while ; after that , something needs to be done with the big gorilla . \\nnobody ever figures out what to do with the big gorilla . \\n',\n",

       " b'steve martin took an extended vacation from all facets of moviemaking a few years back ; he spent this time writing essays and short stories for \" the new yorker , \" several of which wound up in his hilarious hardback compilation , pure drivel ( 1998 ) . \\nmuch of the book spares tinseltown from mockery , although he does riff on the racist comments made by marlon brando during a larry king interview , in a fine chapter called \" in search of the wily filipino . \" \\nnow , as writer and star of bowfinger , he offers the masses plenty of good reasons not to pursue a career in the cinema , perhaps finally venting the frustrations ( \\'everything being made now is crap\\' ) that led to his brief retirement from hollywood . \\nmartin stars as bobby bowfinger , a roger corman-wannabe on the cusp of fifty and desperate for some success as a producer , quality of the projects be damned . \\nhis accountant ( adam alexi-malle ) proposes a movie called \" chubby rain , \" about aliens who travel to earth in raindrops slightly fatter than regular raindrops . \\nbowfinger latches onto the idea immediately , and convinces his troupe of actor friends to appear in the film , based on the lie that america\\'s top box office draw , kit ramsey ( murphy ) , has agreed to star . \\nramsey , of course , wants nothing to do with such low-grade material , so bowfinger , on the thinking that action stars need to run , not speak , decides to photograph the superstar surreptitiously . \\nhe sends his cast members ( who aren\\'t in on it , either ; they are told ramsey hates the sight of cameras and fraternizing with his co-stars ) to ramsey\\'s table at restaurants , asks them to follow him in parking lots , etc . , spouting script dialogue , all the while shooting the outcome from a great distance . \\nthe paranoid ramsey flees the scene nearly every time . \\nramsey is a member of mind head , a cultish self-help organization apparently dedicated to recruiting celebrities . \\n ( as if that\\'s not familiar enough , mind head guru terry stricter ( terence stamp ) has been dressed and combed to resemble l . ron hubbard , founder of scientology . ) \\nwhen he goes to mind head with tales of caucasian strangers appearing from nowhere to babble \" white code \" in his face , they fear the nervous breakdown of an important client and rush him off to a retreat , requiring bowfinger to find a stand-in . \\nmurphy will probably win more fans as jiff , ramsey\\'s adorable , ignoramus double , than as kit , but it is his portrayal of the latter that took courage . \\nalways surrounded by an entourage , suffering from a racial inferiority complex , murphy plays right into the tabloid image of himself . \\nfurthermore , consider the enemies he\\'ll make of popular scientologists . \\npacing stricter\\'s neutral-coloured office as if on an amphetamine binge and stripped of his bigshot veneer , ramsey is asked to shout inane personal affirmations repeatedly . \\nmurphy\\'s scenes with stamp are exactly what i imagine of a john travolta \" clearing . \" \\nnot that murphy is entirely responsible for this schtick ; bowfinger is steve martin\\'s invention . \\nhis script is surprisingly clever as satire , given that the pseudo-religion is a sitting duck , as is the entire los angeles film industry . \\n ( the griffin mill-types take quite a beating , in the form of robert downey jr . as bigwig jerry renfro . ) \\nmartin\\'s decision to tell the story from a bottom feeder\\'s point of view is what keeps it fresh and innovative-never have we seen on screen a group of people struggle this hard to complete a motion picture . \\nas expected , there are laughs only to be had insiders or buffs , such as martin\\'s crew of mexican border-jumpers , who gain unexpected appreciation for the classics from reading \" cahiers du cinema , \" or martin\\'s nonsensical explanation to dave , his loyal cinematographer ( jamie kennedy ) , that every movie , in the end , has a budget of two-thousand dollars ( ! ) . \\nmost of bowfinger is universally funny , however ; i defy any viewer to keep a straight face when christine baranski , one of our brightest comediennes , is on screen . \\nbowfinger\\'s main flaw is a plot twist that has an insubstantial aftermath . \\nwe\\'re also asked to believe that a few simple close-ups of kit ramsey would redeem \" chubby rain , \" z-grade entertainment that would make ed wood blush . \\n ( this aspect of bowfinger has much in common with the ludicrous oscar sequence in oz\\'s last directorial effort , the poorly conceived in & out . ) \\nthese are significant enough weaknesses that they distracted from my enjoyment of the piece . \\nas i mentioned at the start of this review , bowfinger offers solid reasons not to do what heather graham\\'s character daisy does : hop a bus to hollywood in search of stardom . \\nthat said , it offers one fantastic reason to get on that bus : the sense of community between filmmakers who gel is awesome . \\nmartin gets sentimental by story\\'s end as he did in l . a . story , and how could he not ? \\nfor those who can hack it , the movies might be the greatest business in the world . \\n',\n",

       " b'warning : if you actually wish to see the film , stop reading this and see it . \\nwhile i don\\'t blow any plot details , the more you know about a movie , the more disappointing and built up it becomes ( waiting a month to see titanic did the same thing ) . \\nbut , in a nutshell , it\\'s a good film . \\nstar wars episode i : the phantom menace reviewed by vince yim \\nnever having been the biggest star wars fanatic in the world ( i was more into star trek : the next generation ) , it is difficult to relate to the mass fandom surrounding the latest installment , the phantom menace . \\nhowever , it can\\'t be ignored . \\nendless toys lining the shelves , endless news reports , and a multi-billion dollar advertising campaign makes it all the more difficult . \\nwith the level of this hype , one would recall an overhyped disaster from 1998 , godzilla , which definitely failed to live up to expectations . \\nthankfully , the phantom menace does much , much better . \\nwhile the \" first \" star wars trilogy told the story of jedi knight luke skywalker , the prequels backpedal to tell the back-story of obi wan kenobi and a young jedi named anakin skywalker ( who would become the father of luke and eventually become darth vader ) . \\nwithout blowing too much of the story , the phantom menace evolves around a peaceful planet naboo , which is being held hostage by a greedy trade federation , and it\\'s up to two jedi knights ( qui-gon ji , played by liam neeson and obi-wan kenobi , played by ewan mcgreggor ) to free it . \\nthe phantom menace has taken a literal beating from various film critics , leaving me to lower my expectations somewhat . \\ncommon complaints range from lack of characterization , weak narrative , poor direction of actors , the dated style , and too much focus over special effects . \\nstill , film critics often apply much historical theory in regards to film criticism , much of which the average film buff does not care for . \\nhence , this film is a lot of fun and definitely an improvement over the previous films ( even with the \" improvements \" in the special editions ) . \\nthere are many memorable sequences throughout the film , ranging from the fast and furious \" pod race \" sequence ( which is a take on the chariot races in \" ben hur \" ) and the many fight scenes involving legions of battle droids . \\nutilizing technology that is light years beyond anything made before , special effects and computers are used to create everything from monsters to robots to amazing cityscapes with incredible detail . \\nno matter how many times you watch this film , you will catch something new . \\nthe level of humour is a bit higher than the previous films as well , mostly conveyed through the reluctant hero jar jar binks , who belongs to a race known as the gungans . \\nbest described as an mr . bean from the planet naboo , he steals the show . \\nunfortunately , being that he is a computer-generated character , tells a bit about the direction of the actors ( although natalie portman as the queen is pretty effective , as is jake lloyd as the young anakin skywalker ) . \\nwith star wars mania at an all time high , there is the risk that the film will disappoint ( i myself had my doubts ) , which this film does have a tendency to do at times . \\nthere are a few logic problems with the plot , several things are left unchecked , and at times seems to be made only for diehard star wars fans ( although the appearance of the tusken raiders makes for more than a few laughs ) . \\nthat , and young anakin skywalker is a really annoying character , coming off as a smarmy , arrogant brat ( with such an attitude , it\\'s no wonder why he turns to the dark side ) . \\nstill , it seems that many people , especially critics , are missing the point . \\nthe film is some of the most fun 2 and a half hours that you\\'ll blow in your life , which is something i wouldn\\'t mind doing again . \\nwhile it may not have the psychological impact of an academy award contender , who really cares ? \\nthe film is pure fun from beginning to end . \\nand isn\\'t that what really matters ? \\n',\n",
       " b'some movies i should just skip . \\nmy daughter and i had a really vile time at my favorite martian a few weeks back , and here comes another disney effects-filled live-action flick based on an old tv program . \\ntrue , the probgram is only 15 years old this time , and it\\'s a cartoon . \\nbut it\\'s a cartoon i liked , and i was understandably reluctant to see what disney had done to it on the big screen . \\nbut my daughter really wanted to go , and how bad could it be ? \\nturns out i was right , mostly . \\ninspector gadget , oddly enough , follows almost exactly the same format as my favorite martian , down to the jive-talking side-kick . \\nat first i thought it was done by the same people , but imdb informs me that ig was directed by david kellogg and written by dana olsen and kerry ehrin , where mfm was directed by donald petrie and written by sherri stoner and deanna oliver . \\nthis odd similarity between the two movies may best be explained by the studio that produced it , where \" formula \" isn\\'t just business , it\\'s a way of life . \\nthe producers who obviously micromanaged the two projects should get prominant screen credits . \\nin some parts you can just hear them saying \" more zany ! \\ni want more zany here -- and -- here . \" \\n \" let\\'s have a really painful sexual reference for no reason right here -- make it really painful . \\ni want the audience squirming in their seats . \" \\n \" ok , that\\'s fine , but i want you to add bug guts . \" \\n \" what does this scene do ?

       " b'shakespeare in love is quite possibly the most enjoyable period piece ever made for the silver screen . \\nit is both humorous and romantic in a very unique blend that can successfully entertain any audience for the nearly 2 and and a half hours that it occupies . \\nthat is , however , not to say it is a good film , a quality production or anything of the sort . \\nshakespeare in love is an incredibly cheap illusion that truly pans out to be very little quality or original work . \\nthe finest sign of this may be the plot , in looking back , there seems to be little more than a thin , predictable plot that is only carried by the portrayal of people that we revere in our history books . \\nphilip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) owns 1 of the 2 theatres in london . \\nit is at the peak of the royal theatre era , and queen elizabeth ( the recently damed judi dench , by , appropriately enough , queen elizabeth ii ) is very much a fan . \\nhowever , to directly quote the film , he has \" cash flow problems . \" \\nthrough a long set of events , it becomes apparent that his entire life is dependent on his next show doing well enough to pay off his debts . \\nso , mr . henslowe employs the young playwright , william shakespeare ( joseph fiennes ) to pen a comedic production . \\nhowever , the young writer has a severe case of writer\\'s block , and blames it on the fact that his love life is struggling as well . \\nhe has the title in mind , romeo and ethel , the pirate\\'s daughter ( even that joke loses steam after a while ) but can\\'t seem to put words to paper . \\nthen , as only hollywood could have it , through a long set of twisted events , he meets viola de lesseps ( gwyneth paltrow ) and falls madly in love , thus curing his writer\\'s block . \\nthere are many other little issues that mr . henslowe encounters , but they all pan out to be much ado about nothing . \\nthe first realization that i reached in watching this film is that one of the messages given is that a show should not always be credited to it\\'s author . \\nironically , that couldn\\'t be truer here . \\nthe great scenes that will sweep audiences away are not the scenes that fit in the plot , but rather the recitals of shakespearean lines by actors playing actors . \\none of the most breathtaking moments in this film does not involve the character of shakespeare or queen elizabeth or even the theatre owner , but rather 2 young children named romeo and juliet who chose to end their own lives in the name of love . \\nso it is that i am offended by the fact that marc norman and tom stoppard are credited with writing this production , and the name william shakespeare is no were to be seen beyond a character\\'s name in the credits . \\nthe acting in this entertaining yet poor film is often thin to the point that it would not have survived even in queen elizabeth\\'s theatres . \\njoseph fiennes may just be the worst of fall though . \\nhe is tragically unbelievable and comically bad . \\ngwyneth paltrow is little more than satisfactory in her lead position as well . \\nhowever , the supporting cast does almost save the day . \\ngeoffrey rush is nothing short of incredible and judi dench is breathtaking . \\nthey both seem to have shown that as proven actors they could survive in this film of weak links . \\nyou will also find a very good performance by ben affleck in his first real role since good will hunting ( no , armageddon doesn\\'t qualify as real acting . ) . \\nand rupert everett was cute in his small part as well . \\nbut not even they could save this sad excuse for a film , so it remains plagued by poor performances . \\nwhen all is said and done , shakespeare in love is only worth the trip if you want to be entertained . \\nhowever , as the film so kindly pointed out , entertainment may be fun , but it isn\\'t necessarily quality . \\nand this certainly isn\\'t quality . \\nperhaps this may be best compared to a john grisham novel , as a dear friend of mine often does compare things to his work . \\nsimply put , it is far-fetched , poorly crafted , but very entertaining . \\n',\n",

       " b'titantic , writer and director james cameron\\'s much anticipated and sometimes ridiculed $200 , 000 , 000 epic , arrives shortly into the theaters so the question naturally arises , whether the film is worth it ? \\nas a business proposition , it seems hard to see how it can ever break even , but as a movie it is nothing short of wonderful . \\nif you\\'ve already neatly categorized it as yet another disaster movie a la volcano or the poseidon adventure , think again . \\nthe movie is both a great love story told with the disaster as a backdrop and a portrayal of one of the world\\'s most memorable disasters made real and personal by seeing it through the eyes of two young lovers . \\nin either case , it is filmmaking at its best . \\nwhen we entered the press screening , my wife asked the publicity rep if there would be an intermission since the film runs three and a quarter hours long . \\nhe said no but that the time would go by so fast she\\'d never notice the length . \\namazingly , he was right . \\ntitanic is one of the few long films that doesn\\'t suffer because of it . \\nthe lush picture , filmed by russell carpenter in 70mm , opens in the present with two diving subs exploring the wreck of the titanic on the bottom of the ocean . \\nfortune hunter brock lovett ( bill paxton ) leads the expedition looking for the world\\'s most valuable diamond necklace that went down with the ship , known back then as \" the ship of dreams . \" \\nthe necklace\\'s hundred-year-old former owner , rose dewitt bukater ( gloria stuart ) , finds brock to tell him her story . \\nalthough almost all of the movie happens in flashback , one of the engineers shows the elderly rose exactly how the ship was sunk . \\nusing a computer simulation , the movie takes the time to explain what will happen later , which adds immensely to making a lucid story out of what would have otherwise been hopelessly confusing . \\nafter twenty minutes , the story makes its jump to the past as the titanic leaves on her maiden voyage . \\nin a classic movie theme , the two parts of the ship , first class and steerage ( third-class ) exist in sharp contrast . \\nthe strength of the script is the way it paints the differences between rich and poor without excessive moralizing . \\nentering the ship on its day out is rose along with her millionaire fiance , cal hockley , played with perfect snobbishness by billy zane . \\nand thanks to a last minute winning poker hand , an itinerant artist named jack dawson gets himself into a little shared cabin in third class . \\neven with her own promenade deck , rose feels trapped on the ship , what with an upcoming marriage to a man she loathes . \\nin contrast , jack can barely contain his euphoria at being on board . \\nafter jack saves rose from committing suicide , they start a brief but impassioned love affair . \\nnever tawdry and rarely explicit , their romance has the power to sweep the audience into the story . \\nleonardo dicaprio in his best performance ever plays jack with confidence and charisma . \\nin so many ways , small and large , he makes all the right decisions in his approach to the part . \\nwhen he confronts cal , for example , he remains composed and polite and yet subtly undermines every one of cal\\'s supercilious put-downs . \\nkate winslet gives a wonderfully captivating performance as young rose . \\nthe chemistry between these two academy award nominees , him for what\\'s eating gilbert grape and her for sense and sensibility , is nothing short of astonishing . \\nfrom the scene where he embarrasses her by repeatedly asking if she loves her finace to the beautiful one of them hanging off the ship\\'s bow to the one where she embarrasses him by asking him to paint her nude , they dazzle the screen with a pair of mesmerizing performances . \\nif the film breaks after an hour and a half , which is how long cameron wisely waits to have the iceberg show up , you will still get one of the best films of the year . \\npeter lamont\\'s sets are more than authentic . \\none scene , for example , starts with the planning-to-retire captain , played with insouciance by bernard hill , having his tea on deck . \\nit then shifts to the ship\\'s massive gears and then to the bright-hot boiler room filled with sweating muscular men shoveling in the coals . \\nthe handsome interior common rooms of the ship resemble a palace more than an ocean liner . \\neasily the most fascinating part of the story is what happens after the iceberg hits and before the battle with the water begins in earnest . \\nat first , since the iceberg tears a series of little gashes in the hull , not some big gaping hole , the passengers view the hit as more of curiosity than anything else . \\nwhat a lark . \\nwe\\'ve struck an iceberg . \\nnow let\\'s get back to our brandy and cigars . \\nthe ship\\'s musicians play like troopers through it all , even after the panic sets in . \\nafter all , they see it as their duty to calm the passengers . \\nwhen the musicians are about to die , they politely thank each other for the pleasure of being able to play together , and they mean it . \\ntheir civility borders on insanity , but it is touching nevertheless . \\nthe story is so rich that my description has merely touched the surface . \\nthere are more than enough characters to love and to hate , and all of the casting is dead-on . \\nspecial effects work best when their presence becomes almost undetectable . \\nin titanic , for which he created a nine-tenths scale model of the entire ship , cameron strove for accuracy at all costs . \\nthe most dramatic moment in the film happens when the ship breaks in two , and the front section becomes vertical in the water . \\npeople are flung like ants either into the water to be shortly frozen to death or into other parts of the ship to be crushed immediately . \\nbesides being romantic and dramatic , the script includes liberal doses of humor . \\nfrom the many deliciously subtle verbal put-downs to the physical comedy , as when jack teaches rose to spit like a man , the show elicits laughter in addition to perhaps a few tears . \\n \" it\\'s good-bye for a little while , \" a less than confident father tells his little girl since it was indeed women and children first . \\n \" this boat\\'s for mommies and children . \\nthere\\'ll be a boat in a little while for daddies . \" \\nbasically there was a design decision to have fewer than half of the necessary life boats -- it made the decks look too crowded otherwise . \\nperhaps the sinking is best summarized by one of the guggenheim\\'s on-board the ship . \\nin the dining room with the lifeboats gone and the ship certain to sink , he is offered a life jacket by one of the crew . \\n \" no thanks , \" the elegantly attired guggenheim replies . \\n \" we\\'re dressed in our best and would prefer to go down like gentlemen . \\nbut we

       " b\"underrated movies are a common reoccurrence in show business today . \\n1998's 'hope floats' was extremely underrated and was one of the best movies of the year . \\nwe always get films that make big money at the box-office but critics and audiences pan on them . \\nthis year 'double jeopardy' is one of those films . \\ncritics are calling it predictable and worthless , audiences are disappointed with it and think it was a disappointment . \\nbut as i viewed 'double jeopardy' i found that it was a great movie , it has a surprising sense of humor and a big dose of heart , along with heart-pounding suspense and twists and turns here and there it certainly is a really good movie . \\nthe always wonderful ashley judd plays libby parsons , a woman with a seemingly normal life : a great loving husband , a beautiful son and a great friend . \\nher husband nick parsons has made a surprise for her and is going to buy her the sailboat she has always wanted . \\nafter a night of bliss libby wakes up in the middle of the night to find blood all over her and all over the sailboat , her husband is missing and there is a bloody knife on deck . \\nof course being in shock she picks it up and a coast guard comes over and sees her . \\nhowever she isn't immediately ceased until they find out his life insurance was worth two-million dollars and they start to wonder rather she killed him for the money . \\nshe pleads not-guilty but is found guilty and sent to prison for six years . \\nwhile making a phone call to her best friend who adopted her son for her and she hears him say hi to his dad , which makes libby's heart stop right there . \\nshe realizes she must get out and prove that he isn't dead , one of her cell-mates tells her that as long as she has been convicted of a crime she cannot be convicted of it again . \\nwhich means she can shoot him in the middle of mardi gras and they cannot do anything about it . \\nafter she gets out she goes to a halfway house run by parole officer tommy lee jones . \\nhe is a man who has had his share of bad things . \\nwhile out for the day she breaks into a school and tries to track down her kid and husband , leading up to some jaw-dropping twists that are both predictable and not . \\nwhatever happens the film was excellent to me . \\ni found the writing well-written as well as the acting was great . \\nashley judd is such a talented and beautiful actress that she is a hero in a sort in this movie . \\neven if you know what is going to happen in the end , you don't know how . \\nthis is one of those movies that you really do know what is going to happen , except you don't know how they are going to make it happen . \\nit could be one way or another , it could be this way or that way . \\nthe movie is highly stylized and extremely well-made . \\nit gets most of it's power from the two leads : ashley judd and tommy lee jones both give excellent performances . \\nthe characters are well-realized and believable and we feel libby's pain when she cannot see her child for 6 years . \\neven though a lot of critics didn't like the film , i loved it . \\nthe director took his time making the movie , and put a lot of shadowing in the movie . \\ni found it not to be boring at all and it's only flaw comes from some predictability . \\nit moved at a fast pace , has suspense , humor , heart and great acting . \\nit earns it's right to be a great movie and to me that's what it was . \\n\",\n",
       " b'john von neumann , progenitor of the computer age and critically important mathematician on the manhattan project , pointed out long ago that there is a great way to explore the cosmos , even without recourse to faster-than light travel . \\nyou send out self-replicating robot ships which explore and radio back information . \\nit may take decades , centuries , or millennia , but it can be done with achievable technology , and doesn\\'t require a magical faster-than-light drive . \\nin the fifties , british astronomer fred hoyle improved on this plan by suggesting that it would be better to radio plans for a complex computer and a program for it ; any civilization capable of receiving the transmission could build the computer , which would then engage in a real-time dialog with the aliens , exchanging information and technologies , and hopefully arranging to send back what it had learned . \\nabout thirty-five years ago , the bbc contracted with astronomer/writer fred hoyle and writer frank elliot to create the scripts for a mini-series called a for andromeda . \\nafa concerned the reception of a hoyle transmission , the construction of a huge computer , the computer\\'s analysis of life on earth , and its creation of an apparently human intermediary to facilitate communication . \\nshe was played with ethereally inhuman perfection by the then-unknown julie christie . \\naudience response was so strong that the bbc contracted for a sequel , andromeda breakthrough , which played to equally high ratings . \\ndennis feldman , whose previous credits include the golden child , has never been noted for coherent , well-structured movie scripts ; they start out great , and then disintegrate into a morass of chase and action , mitigated only by the presence of the obligatory beautiful girl . \\nfeldman writes good scenes , but has no idea how to tell a story or write a movie , even with a previous version to use as a model . \\nnow , in species , we have a mundane retread of the andromeda plotline , derailed by a preoccupation with removing the clothes from the leading lady and further ruined by a mediocre attempt to emulate several recent horror films in terms of splatter , gore , and chases . \\nspecies features ben kingsley , who is completely wasted in a badly-written portrayal of a feebly amoral scientist . \\nforest whitaker and alfred molina are also served poorly by the script . \\nthe species story is relatively simple ; we have been radioing information about ourselves and our dna out into space since 1971 , and have been receiving answers for two years . \\n ( note that , in the 1970\\'s , we really didn\\'t know diddly about the human genome structure , and were hardly in a position to radio out a set of blueprints for human beings . \\neven today , all we can do is give information about dna and how it works , not a copy of human dna , because we don\\'t have it analyzed yet . ) \\nthe answers we get from the unknown alien source are plans for recreating a member of the alien race , and doctor xavier finch , played by ben kingsley , is placed in charge of the attempt . \\nthe script begins to go off the deep end at this point , when the result is a beautiful young girl who can shape-shift into any of several ugly alien life forms . \\nthe first half of the film has something to offer , as \" sil , \" the alien girl , struggles with her multi-form existence , changing from beauty to lizard to giant cockroach and back again , all while trying to understand her own place in the cosmos . \\nshe seems oddly knowledgeable about human society , with glaring gaps where her social skills should be . \\nher instincts are to mate and procreate , and some of the best scenes deal with her attempts in this area . \\nescaping from her birth laboratory in utah , sil is pursued by a team of drafted civilians with orders to find her and kill her . \\nshe goes on an eating binge , spins herself a cocoon , and emerges as an adult , played by natasha henstridge , who goes a long way toward re-creating the sheerly inhuman beauty julie christie achieved in 1960 . \\nthe pursuers : michael madsen is an assassin/exterminator ; forrest whitaker is a convenient empath/psychic , just as though the u . s . government actually had such people on call . \\nneither is able to do much with the writing and directing provided . \\nwhitaker\\'s role seems to be aimed at making whitaker a male copy of star trek : the next generation\\'s \" counselor cleavage . \" \\nthe other members of the strike team are played by marg helgenberger and alfred molina . \\nkingsley and whitaker are both consummate professionals , too good to not work to the best of their abilities ; but the performances donaldson elicited from the rest of the cast are disappointing and bland , and it is apparent that the direction was a bit weak . \\nh . r . giger\\'s design for the main form of the alien creature is actually a bit boring when we finally get to see it , although previous digital effects were done quite smoothly . \\nthe main fault of species is lack of originality ; it starts out with a wonderful , albeit borrowed , premise , and then doesn\\'t live up to it . \\nall we get are chase scenes and a few nice sex scenes , with a few monsters tossed in . \\nthere is no buildup of tension and suspense , no climax worthy of the name ; species is just a sequence of \" scare \" scenes stuck together . \\nthe movie is carried by its chase and sex scenes , but not rescued by them . \\non the other hand , as an exercise in sci-fi action/ adventure , it certainly beats the ichor out of judge dredd . \\nspecies earns an extra rating point or two for having ben kingsley and natasha henstridge on board , but by and large , it\\'s fun only for those of us who really like this sort of thing . \\nmy personal rating is three stars , but knock one or two of those off if you don\\'t enjoy pretty unclothed ladies and bloodthirsty alien monsters . \\nmpaa classification : r ( violence , gore , nudity , sex , language ) \\nstars : ben kingsley , michael madsen , forest whitaker , alfred molina , marg helgenberger , natasha henstridge directed by : roger donaldson produced by : frank mancuso jr . and dennis feldman typed by : dennis feldman cinematography : andrzej bartkowiak music : christopher young run time : 108 minutes aspect ratio : 2 . 35 : 1 from mgm , opens 7 july 1995 \\n',\n",
       " b'i feel no hesitation in saying that \" there\\'s something about mary \" is the best film that i will see all year . \\nfrom the moment the credits started to roll at the end of the picture , there was no doubt in my mind that i had seen a masterpiece that will remain unsurpassed in the remaining months of 1998 . \\nit is that good of a film . \\nwhen gene siskel said this about \" fargo \" only a few months into \\'96 , i dismissed the notion as ridiculous . \\nhow could you possibly know that a film is so great that nothing you could possibly see in the future could beat it ? \\nbut after seeing the farrelly\\'s hilarious and surprisingly heartfelt masterwork , i now know what siskel was talking about . \\nonce in a ( very great ) while , a film comes along that is so daring , so brilliant and simply so enjoyable that at the end , you just want to stand up and cheer . \\nand you know , at that instant , that you have just experienced something very special . \\nnow for the shocker ; \" mary \" is the grossest and most disgusting film i have ever viewed ( \" pink flamingos \" obviously notwithstanding ) . \\nthe movie is so rude and , i guess , inappropriate in nature that i had a hard time sitting in a theater watching it with my parents ( luckily i had seen it before them , so i could warn the about what they were in for ) . \\nforget \" blazing saddles \" , \" animal house \" and even the former king of gross-out comedy , \" monty python\\'s meaning of life \" ; they were all only preludes to the farrelly\\'s assault on the senses . \\nin fact , this may even be the funniest film i\\'ve ever had the pleasure of seeing ( the only real contender is \" monty python and the holy grail \" ) , and most certainly the most hilarious to come out all decade . \\nbut as funny as it is , something also has to be said about the overall sweetness of \" mary \" ; it has a huge heart . \\nyou see , the farrelly\\'s are truly gifted filmmakers . \\nthey don\\'t just present you with a string of dick and fart jokes ( although there are plenty to go around ) . \\nthey also , very wisely , add an unbelievable amount of charisma to the main characters and actually have them develop as the story progresses . \\nit\\'s funny , though . \\nif you just look at an outline of the story , it seems kind of contrived and predictable . \\nbut believe me , it is anything but . \\nben stiller plays ted , a very shy and clumsy teenage geek who lusts after the school babe , mary ( cameron diaz ) . \\nafter he sticks up for her retarded brother , warren ( w . \\nearly brown - the cameraman , believe it or not , from \" scream \" ) , his dreams come true when she invites him to the prom . \\nin one of the film\\'s funniest scenes , something goes wrong ( i won\\'t ruin it for those who know nothing about the film ) and ted is unable to face mary ever again . \\njump to the present . \\nafter years of self-loathing , ted finally hires private detective pat healy ( a suitably slimy matt dillon ) to track her down so he can have one last chance at winning the woman he has loved since high school . \\nhealy finds that mary is still a full-blown hottie and decides to try and keep her for himself . \\nadmittingly , the basic story line leaves a little to be desired . \\nafter all , with a not-really-all-that-funny premise , how can you sustain laughter for nearly two hours ? \\nsomehow , the farrelly\\'s pull it off . \\nthe performances here are also right on target . \\nas ted , stiller adds just the right amount of clumsy charm to make his character not irritating , as he would normally be , but very lovable . \\nand cameron diaz is perfect in her role for obvious reasons , but the actor who really grabs your attention is w . earl brown as mary\\'s brother . \\nno other actor has even come close to playing a mentally retarded man with as much natural ease as brown displays here . \\ni know he won\\'t be nominated , but this is the guy who should not be counted out when it comes time to hand out the oscar nods in february . \\nas good as the actors are , though , it\\'s the directors\\' movie all the way . \\ni guarantee that on almost every other top ten list at the end of the year , you will see the number one space occupied by steven spielberg\\'s wwii epic \" saving private ryan \" . \\nand yes , that is a great film worthy of the recognition it has been getting . \\nbut which is harder ; making a great war film or having your audience laugh so hard that they can\\'t breath for minutes at a time ? \\ni\\'ll let you decide that one for yourself , but this critic is sticking to his guns . \\nthere is just something about \" mary \" . \\n',\n",

       " b'in wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \\\\ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance . \\never since wall street , douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80\\'s . \\nin those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen , with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world . \\nyou\\'d think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer , but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton , douglas played the role straight and out in the open . \\nin wonder boys his performance isn\\'t showy or a tour de force , it\\'s simple yet truthful . \\nhe embodies grady , a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes . \\ngrady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map . \\nwhen we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop , we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms . \\ngrady points out , in his narration , that they only do so out of jealousy . \\ntheir target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire ) , a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for . \\nleer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions . \\nhe speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges . \\nhe\\'s portentous and gloomy , as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers , though his act is a little too calculated . \\nhe reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director , jim jarmusch ( dead man , ghost dog ) . \\nwhenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer ) , exclusively dressed in black , and with his spiked hair dyed snow white . \\nleer is similar , a guy who equates quirks with depth . \\ntobey maguire fits well in the role . \\nwith his round , sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude . \\nbut unlike cort , maguire is easier to warm up to ; he\\'s a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility . \\nkatie holmes plays hannah , a beautiful , talented writing student just itching to get in grady\\'s pants . \\nthis is a plot line i had trouble with . \\ndouglas , in his old age , is beginning to resemble jerry springer , a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions . \\nat first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe it\\'s because i\\'m jealous , and wish holmes was throwing herself at me , after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth ) , then i think of douglas\\'s real life companion , the breathtaking catherine zeta jones . \\nseeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping . \\nsuddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and i\\'m pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas . \\nthere is a movie in there somewhere . \\ngrady , rather chivalrously if you ask me , resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand ) , who is his age , but also married to another professor . \\nokay , maybe not so chivalrous . \\nthere is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says , \" she was a junkie for the printed word . \\nlucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice \" . \\nrobert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm . \\ndowny has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual . \\nhe\\'s arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance . \\nthe actor is perfectly cast here , and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor . \\ni wish wonder boys had more of him . \\nsearching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless , for it meanders through its running time , but that\\'s part of its charm . \\nand maybe i\\'m a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia , a place i\\'m greatly fond of , and a place rarely explored in american cinema . \\neveryone has a sub-genre ( be it war films , westerns , dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to . \\ni\\'m privy to films about literary types i . e . \\nthose individuals enthralled by the written word , and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch . \\nthe direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters , rather than generic mapped out story points . \\nsometimes the dialogue is too clever , but that\\'s a problem i wish i found with films more often . \\nanother minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted , like its characters , but as the story progresses it begins to open up . \\nfor me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types , and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags . \\nthe gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h , the long goodbye ) movies , where jokes exist as asides on the fringes , like jokes in life often do . \\nthe broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog , and incessant smoking of marijuana isn\\'t ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things . \\ncurtis hanson , who before his last film , la confidential , toiled about with exploitation fare like losin\\' it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle , has graduated to more meaningful films . \\nhe directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style , the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up . \\nthe morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party , but in a wonder boys party , it fits . \\nthe film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen . \\nit\\'s the cinematic equivalent to a good read , novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies . \\nmany will find it slight , but i found much to savor among its subtleties . \\n',\n",

       " b\"several days after having seen this movie , i'm still trying to determine what director christopher guest , a man whose sense of humor i usually appreciate , found funny in either the concept or the execution of almost heroes . \\nthis is a dreadful motion picture ? a lowbrow example of period piece comedy with terrible production values and an exceptionally poor laughs-to-jokes ratio . \\nthere's a kind of desperation in the movie's approach to humor that reveals the film makers' uncertainty about how entertaining the material is ; the manic style betrays itself as a last-ditch attempt to hide the flaws of a failed script . \\nthe premise doesn't sound especially amusing to begin with ? almost heroes tells the tale of two explorers , the effeminate leslie edwards ( matthew perry ) and the uncouth bartholomew hunt ( chris farley ) , who are racing lewis and clark on the trip to the american northwest . \\nedwards and hunt are accompanied by the kinds of weirdoes we find in road movies ( albeit of the early-19th century variety ) , including a frenchman named guy fontenot who claims to speak hundreds of languages ( none of which prove to be useful ) , a pretty indian maiden who turns into the obligatory love interest , and a bizarre man who suffers a series of debilitating injuries . \\nalong the way , the intrepid explorers encounter bears , bald eagles , aging native american warriors , and a conquistador named hildago ( kevin dunn ) who raves about his beautiful hair . \\nthe explorers' trek takes them through forests , across the snow-capped rocky mountains , and over a waterfall . \\nthis setup leads to a lot of shouting , a great deal of lunacy , and very few laughs . \\nfarley engages in his usual shtick of falling down and bellowing , but , aside from an momentarily diverting confrontation with an eagle , his heart doesn't seem to be in it . \\nmatthew perry , one of the stars of tv's friends ( who had some modest success in the romantic comedy , fools rush in ) is badly miscast . \\nas a foil for farley and an antidote to his runaway energy , perry lacks the necessary edge of the proverbial straight man . \\ni'm not a big fan of david spade , and i didn't like tommy boy , but at least he and farley worked well together . \\nas far as the supporting players go , none of them makes more than a fleeting impression . \\neugene levy is wasted , and kevin dunn is about as interesting here as he is in godzilla . \\nfrankly , it's a disappointment to see something this dumb and ugly come from christopher guest , the brilliant comic force behind such films as this is spinal tap , the big picture , and waiting for guffman . \\nalthough guest gets the costumes right , this nearly-inconsequential success is no substitute for the weak script and unfunny execution . \\nthe special effects , such as they are , are execrable . \\nfor an example of some really poor blue screen work , look at the scenes where the characters are shooting the rapids ( they're obviously getting buckets of water thrown on them ) and where farley is being carried off by an eagle . \\neven though farley didn't have the most stellar of acting careers , he doesn't deserve the kind of unfortunate epitaph offered by almost heroes . \\nwhile some of the more outrageous attempts at humor may coax a few guffaws from 12-year old boys , the level of comedy in almost heroes falls far below the level of sophomoric . \\nfarley fans who see this film as a way to say goodbye should be commended for their loyalty , since it takes real stamina to stay seated for the full running length of this cinematic torture session . \\n\",\n",

paranoia , jealousy , and blind rage . \\nsex and violence are inextricably linked . \\nthe title is apt ? la motta is a raging bull . \\nin the ring , he is a terror , not just beating his opponents , but destroying them . \\noutside of it , he is no less vicious or more easily controlled . \\nthe two people who spar with him on life\\'s canvas are his wife , vicki ( cathy moriarty ) , and his brother/manager , joey ( joe pesci ) . \\nthese are the two who mean the most to jake , and who , as a result of his inability to trust himself or others , he loses . \\nhe beats vicki mercilessly because he suspects her of infidelity , and , when he inaccurately believes that his brother betrayed him , his lets loose with an explosion of violence . \\nraging bull opens in 1941 when la motta , an up-and-coming fighter , is battling his way into the upper echelon of the middleweight class . \\nover the years , he wins several key bouts , including one against his arch-rival , sugar ray robinson ( johnny barnes ) , but his unwillingness to capitulate with the local godfather keeps him from an opportunity to participate in a championship match . \\nmeanwhile , away from the ring , la motta falls in love with 15-year old vicki , who he marries after discarding his shrewish first wife . \\nvicki becomes jake\\'s greatest prize ( a wife , in his view , is not a companion , but a possession ) and the source of his most extreme pain . \\nhis own insecurity is so great that he cannot accept that a woman as beautiful as vicki could be faithful to him . \\nhence , he is constantly haunted by a belief that she is sleeping with someone else ? perhaps even his brother . \\n ( this leads to the famous line parodied in waiting for guffman and elsewhere : \" are you f * * king my wife ? ? ? \" ) \\nin the late \\'40s , la motta gets his first shot at a championship fight , but with one huge condition : he must take a fall . \\nhe does it so badly that an investigation is launched and he is almost thrown out of boxing . \\ntwo years later , he wins the championship , only to lose it in a subsequent bout to sugar ray . \\nby the late \\'50s and early \\'60s , when the film ends , jake has become a pathetic figure ? a broke , overweight loser who has spent time in jail for corrupting the morals of a minor , has lost his wife and children , and is trying to earn a few bucks by doing a cheap standup routine . \\nraging bull is the other side of rocky . \\nsylvester stallone\\'s tale of boxing triumph was released to great critical acclaim in 1976 . \\nit won the 1977 best picture oscar , and a sequel arrived in theaters before raging bull went into production . \\nbut , where rocky romanticizes boxing , raging bull takes a cold , unflinching look at the violence both inside and outside of the ring . \\nwhile scorsese\\'s primary aim is to present a riveting deconstruction of la motta the man , he never backs away from showing the seedy , ugly underside of a sport where gambling , greed , and organized crime force fighters to throw matches to continue working . \\nrocky shows boxing at its noblest ; raging bull shows it at its most diseased . \\nthere\\'s little i can say here that hasn\\'t already said about de niro\\'s performance . \\nin a career that has included many fine roles , this is his most outstanding . \\nthe level of intensity de niro brings to la motta is unwavering . \\nand , although there\\'s a lot of travis bickle ( de niro\\'s character in taxi driver ) in la motta , scorsese and de niro go to great lengths to make sure that , if we never fully sympathize with him , at least we understand the forces that drive him . \\nthis is a complete characterization and a perfect example of acting . \\nas the younger jake , de niro is trim and fit . \\nas the fat , older man , de niro gained 50 pounds and turned his body into a grotesque parody of its normal form . \\nhow many actors would go that far ? \\nthe best oscar statue is only one testimony to the lasting power of the performance . \\ncathy moriarty and joe pesci both earned nominations for their supporting work ( although neither won ) . \\ntheir portrayals have the same raw energy that infuses de niro\\'s . \\npesci , who has basically re-created the same personality in two other scorsese films ( goodfellas and casino ) , presents joey as a slightly more intelligent version of his brother . \\nthe misogyny and violence are still there , only better concealed . \\nbut , when joey snaps , as he does in one scene where he pounds on a mobster ( frank vincent ) , it\\'s startling to behold . \\nmoriarty , on the other hand , must play the temptress with virginal qualities ? the only kind of woman who would ensnare jake . \\nlater , she\\'s called upon to portray the battered wife and mother whose love has turned into fear . \\nscorsese and cinematographer michael chapman elected to shoot the bulk of raging bull in black-and-white ( a few \" home movie \" segments are in color ) . \\nthe choice is perfect for the movie , giving raging bull a unique look in an era when a black-and-white approach is almost unheard of . \\n ( one important recent exception , schindler\\'s list , eschewed color for some of the same reasons that raging bull did . ) \\nin black-and-white ( especially considering scorsese\\'s choice of shots and use of slow motion ) , the violence is stark and disturbing . \\nthere\\'s no room for romanticism in the ring with inky black blood staining the canvas . \\nduring fight sequences , the director also uses a number of point-of-view shots designed to show the world , however briefly , from la motta\\'s perspective . \\nscorsese could have chosen to end the film with la motta\\'s loss to sugar ray , where he surrendered his middleweight crown . \\nafter that , his career was all downhill . \\nyet the director allows the film to run for thirty minutes after this pivotal moment , stretching more than a decade into la motta\\'s future . \\nthe reason is obvious : scorsese isn\\'t as interested in boxing as he is in the character . \\nfollowing his retirement , la motta is still as violent and volatile as ever , but he has lost the arena in which he can legally unleash those tendencies . \\nwe see the results of this beast let loose on society and how the consequences of his actions reduce him to a parody of his former self . \\nwho cannot feel a surge of pity for la motta as he quietly recites marlon brando\\'s speech from on the waterfront ? \\n ( \" i coulda been a contenda . \" ) \\nperhaps raging bull is indeed the best film of the \\'80s . \\nand , if not , it\\'s certainly perilously close to the zenith . \\n',\n",

       " b\"accepting his oscar as producer of this year's best picture winner , saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over . \\none could almost say the same about his much-prized film . \\nrarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery , symbolism , ideas and metaphors , complex and literate storytelling , all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny , an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth . \\nin short , the antithesis of all things hollywood . \\nyet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind . \\nralph fiennes is the title character , an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory , and particularly the memory of love , is the ostensible focus of the film . \\nbut despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together , we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him . \\nhis emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld . \\nthe same can easily be said for every other character in the film , of which there are too many . \\njuliette binoche's nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart . \\nat least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her , and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious , disfigured , dying stranger . \\neven this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion , however , that it verges on the comical . \\nwith so many characters enjoying so little screen time , the film's 160 minutes can be taxing . \\nyet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldn't help but feel that greatness was in the air . \\nhints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war . \\nthere is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years . \\nbut ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed . \\nin the end , i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore . \\nbore is perhaps too strong a word . \\nbut after drinking in the rich production values , the cup remains only slightly over half-full . \\n\",\n",

       " b'the thought-provoking question of tradition over morals is the subject directly at the core of \" leila , \" a powerfully articulated and subtle drama from famous iranian director dariush mehrjui , that is his first motion picture in a prosperous thirty-year career to gain u . s . distribution , thanks to first run features . \\nalthough unfamiliar with mehrjui\\'s previous directing efforts , perhaps the reason for this is that , while the predicament at hand is no doubt exclusive to its own country , the heartbreaking and solely truthful emotions of the characters can easily be understood by all viewers . \\nset in modern-day iran , \" leila \" begins on the birthday of the title character ( leila hatami ) , after a brief prologue in which we are shown the first encounter between leila and her future husband , reza ( ali mosaffa ) . \\nas leila and reza set off to visit his parents , and then hers , where a birthday celebration has been planned , things seem rosy for the couple on the outside , but for leila , life isn\\'t quite as sweet . \\nearlier , on that very same day , leila had gone to see her physician , and has ultimately discovered that she holds very little chance of ever conceiving a child . \\nwhen all of the conditions are ruled out , and leila passes up the possibility of adoption , reza firmly and lovingly tells her that he married her , and doesn\\'t care at all about having children . \\nnonetheless , leila is ashamed that she will never be able to give him a baby , which is the societal norm , and her self-esteem is not helped at all by her domineering mother-in-law ( jamileh sheikhi ) , whose hopes to carry on the sacred family name vanishes once hearing the news ( reza is her only son ) . \\nbluntly explaining to leila that reza has always wished for children and , in a country where polygamy is an accepted tradition , she suggests that he take a second wife to bear a child with . \\nleila hesitantly agrees , and while she and reza are able to shallowly laugh afterwards about the hopeful womens\\' inadequacies , reza finally does meet a woman whom he claims to like , even though he refuses to go through with the marriage if leila doesn\\'t give her full blessing . \\nthere are no easy answers to be found within \" leila , \" a film that thoughtfully examines the central character\\'s unfortunate plight , as well as the inner workings of leila herself , told through matter-of-fact narration . \\nalmost completely taken over by her own shame , she has no option but to agree to her forceful mother-in-law\\'s requests , even though she is unsure of how she will react if reza really does end up marrying another woman . \\nmaybe because \" leila \" is from iran , the film will unquestionably be shocking for american audiences , since the concept of polygamy is looked upon by the characters as a more or less everyday occurrence . \\nleila , however , is unable to come to terms with the idea quite as easily , but feels it is her duty to make her husband happy , no matter what the circumstances . \\none of the strongest aspects of the film is in its portrayal of the relationship between leila and reza , who married only three months after their first meeting , but obviously love each other very deeply . \\nit is this relationship that is the key ingredient to making what follows the opening scenes all the more powerful , and director mehrjui has succeeded just about as well as possible . \\nalthough seemingly unimportant at first glance , an early sequence where leila and reza are eating dinner and both are laughing , nearly uncontrollably , actually is one of the most vital moments in the first half , as it unmistakably sets the boundary for their unrequisite love for one another . \\nditto for another scene in which reza gives leila a large stuffed animal for her birthday , and then reveals a beautiful necklace he has also gotten her . \\nthese \" small \" moments are the perfect contrast for the solemn , outraging sequences in the latter half , in which reza drops leila off at the side of a busy road , and then zooms off to go on a date with another woman . \\nleft there to ponder her quickly diminishing marriage , foolishly unbeknownst to reza , leila prays each time that the date will not go well , so she will be able to keep her husband to herself for a little while longer . \\nrefusing to stay over at her parent\\'s house , the film inevitably leads up to the second wedding night between reza and another woman , and in a sequence of extraordinary sorrow and potency , leila finds her whole being emotionally torn apart , as she is closed up in an upstairs bedroom as the marriage proceedings are going on down below . \\ndespite her initial agreement to such a thing , leila realizes how much she has been betrayed by reza , whom she believed cared for her as much as she did of him . \\nsure , the whole second marriage was his mother\\'s idea , but if he really did believe what he initially had told her about not wanting any children , then he could have still easily backed out , couldn\\'t he ? \\nin the pivotal role of leila , who appears in every scene , leila hatami is nothing short of remarkable , injecting her character with an equal measure of startling strength , unavoidable vulnerability , and utter despair . \\nunlike most american films , in which everything always has to be spelled out for audiences , hatami says much more with just an elusive expression on her face than could possibly have been conveyed by words . \\nevery bit a perfect match for hatami is ali mosaffa , as reza , a man who , i believe , does hold an unbreakable bond with his wife , but is too naive to realize what he will be doing to leila if he marries someone else . \\nfor all of its strong aspects , \" leila \" isn\\'t a perfect film . \\non a technical level , i found many blatant punctiation and spelling mistakes within the subtitles that need to be fixed . \\nand concerning the plot developments , the final five minutes ring false when compared with everything that has come before . \\nmehrjui\\'s decision to use an extremely stylized approach to the ending was the wrong choice , particularly in his almost comedic way of wrapping up the character of the spiteful mother-in-law , played memorably by jamileh sheikhi . \\ndespite these minor missteps , \" leila \" is an important motion picture that should definately be sought out upon its limited may 16 release at new york\\'s cinema village , and then on may 21 in la . \\nthe thought-provoking questions that the film deals with is balanced evenly with its uneasy morales , and when the climax arrives , leila\\'s self-worth is startlingly stripped away to reveal a victim led into complete devastation , to which there is no return . \\nit\\'s difficult to not consider how leila\\'s culminating interior demise could have been so simply avoided , had the other characters taken a second out of their own selfish lives to consider what leila , the major pawn in the unforgivable scheme , was going through . \\n',\n",

\" \\ncharacter and proceeds to repeat variations of that line for the majority of the film even though he stays . \\nanyone who can\\'t immediately tell that bob gunton ( the bad guy in patch adams and countless other films ) is going to eventually turn on the gang and side with his creations before his eminent death will probably be surprised , but i highly doubt it . \\neven if he hadn\\'t been the villain in just about every film he\\'s ever been in , so many obvious hints are given to indicate the devious act that it holds no shock whatsoever . \\nin fact , his death is welcome , because it finally starts moving the plot towards the finale . \\nif the plot doesn\\'t sound ridiculous to you yet , then check out these little tidbits : a multitude of bats inexplicably disperses when a police officer cocks his pistol . \\nan entire town disregards the sheriff and doctor\\'s orders to stay indoors after a curfew is instigated , causing mass hysteria when the bats come out in full force , killing several townsfolk . \\na government official blows off shelia\\'s instructions ( to wait until dawn to install a cooling unit in the bats\\' cave that will kill all of them off ) by pulling a night job , resulting in the death of an entire military unit . \\na cavern full of bat feces never ignites when a phosphorus flare is lit right in the middle of it . \\nfinally , to top it all off , this little texas town is showing nosferatu in it\\'s single screen theater ( for reference , our town has over a million people in it with nearly 150 movie screens , and we\\'re lucky to even get kevin smith\\'s dogma ) . \\nthe most laughable part of the movie though comes from the ill-conceived bat puppets . \\nwhile the actual bat attack scenes are shot with rapid fire editing ( making the scenes nearly impossible to comprehend what\\'s going on ) , the scenes where a bat is called upon to interact with a live actor are usually shot more low-key . \\ntherefore we the audience get loving close-ups of the most unrealistic , rubbery bat puppets ever committed to film . \\nbeing able to see the puppeteer\\'s arms would be the only things that could have made these creations worse . \\nafter all of this , if you still decide bats might be the movie for you , don\\'t say you haven\\'t been warned . \\ntrust me when i say that it\\'s a lot more fun to trash than it is to sit through . \\ni just wish that dina meyer would be cast in more roles or at least choose better films to appear in . \\nshe\\'s definitely a talent that is going to waste in films like these . \\n',\n",

       " b'when people are talking about good old times , they actually want to make some bad times look better . \\nnice example of such behaviour is contemporary attitude of popular media towards the 1970s . \\nfor new generations , superseventies are the lost golden age of chic fashion , cult tv shows and sexual freedom unchecked by aids . \\nfor people who actually had to live in that period , it was the gloomy decade , marked by lost ideals of 1968 , rampant inflation and unemployment , international terrorism , fuel crisis and loss of faith in almost anything that previous generation stood for . \\nfeelings of despair and nihilism found its reflections in many films of that era . \\nmartin scorsese\\'s taxi driver , which symbolises both the glory and despair of the seventies , is most celebrated of them all . \\nthe movie\\'s protagonist is travis bickle ( robert de niro ) , 26-year old former marine who takes the job of taxi driver in new york city because he can\\'t sleep at nights . \\nthe job gets him exposed to the dark side of apocalyptic megalopolis , and travis gradually gets alienated from the rest of world . \\nthe only bright spot in his life is betsy ( cybil sheperd ) , attractive woman working in senator palantine\\'s presidential campaign . \\ntheir date ends as humiliating fiasco because travis makes fatal mistake by inviting her to porno movie theatre . \\nlosing his only link to better side of the world , travis gradually descends into psychosis , becoming convinced that his mission in life is to battle scum on the street . \\nhe purchases a formidable arsenal of guns and begins physical preparations for the inevitable conflict . \\nthat conflict finally comes when he takes personal interest in iris ( jodie foster ) , 12-year old prostitute who temporarily took refuge in his taxi . \\nas many great movies that got cult status through the years , taxi driver became the object of many interpretations . \\nfor some critics and scholars it is an exploration of universal subjects that date back to dostoyevski - loss of moral compass in a bleak reality of dirty , overpopulated industrial cities ; the story could have been set in 19th century same as in our times . \\nfor others , the movie uses raskolnikov-like figure in order to portray burning problems of 1970s america - its apparent inability to deal with the consequences of rapid social changes that occurred in previous decade . \\nbrilliant performance of robert de niro in role of a lifetime can give arguments for both sides . \\nhis travis bickle has a lot in common with most of the average viewers of today - many of us share his feelings of isolation , loneliness and outrage towards crime , drugs , prostitution and senseless street violence . \\nhis pathetic attempts to establish some kind of human connection with the people around him , sometimes in most unusual circumstances - like with secret service agents , pimps or job interviewers - make him a person too goofy to be the hero , and too pathetic to be the classic villain . \\nhowever , most of the average viewers are sensible enough to recognise the tin line that separate concerned citizens or troubled souls from fanatical madmen . \\nbut despite anything , average viewer at the end actually cheers for travis - his crusade against \" scum \" is something that average person wants , but doesn\\'t have a stomach/lack of brains to do it . \\nwhile de niro\\'s travis might come in and out of particular times and places , other persons that appear in the film ( mostly played by the character actors ) give it distinctively 1970s feel . \\nwizzard ( played by peter boyle ) presents the only link with america\\'s better past ; but only because he is the oldest taxi driver in company and therefore everybody assumes that he \" knows stuff \" . \\nhis obvious inadequacy in giving advice to troubled travis illustrates the inability of pre-1960s generations to find answers to the problems of gloomy decade . \\nother characters , on the other hand , show the bad side of new age . \\nmatthew \" sport \" ( keitel , who befriended real-life pimps in other to prepare for his role of a lifetime ) is dressed like a hippie ; iris found excuse for her escape to the world of drugs and child prostitution in a ideology of counterculture . \\nporno movies , that should be the element of new times of sexual freedom , are too much even for supposedly \" liberated \" betsy . \\neven the politicians , like senator palantine , are lost in post-vietnam and post-watergate mess ; his broad and senseless \" messages \" that cover the lack of any serious program can\\'t fool even such idiots like travis . \\nthe past is gone , the present is bad , and even the future seems bleak , and the feeling of pessimism can\\'t be washed away even by ironic happy end . \\ntravis and his world found themselves in a desperate situation , and martin scorsese uses the best of his cinematic skills in order to spill the gloom of schrader\\'s screenplay into the silver screen . \\nnew york city in the night is portrayed as a hell on earth , and the red light and steam coming out of sewers give it surreal , almost stygian atmosphere . \\nanother important element of the atmosphere is score of great bernard herrman , whose efficient use of jazz elements gives some melancholy that softens the brutality of motion picture . \\none of the greatest ironies of taxi driver is the fact that the movie was , same as his protagonist , famous for the wrong reason . \\ninstead of receiving cult status because of his artistic merits , for many years it was tabloid-fodder because of hinckley and his real-life re-enactment of events in the movie . \\nnow , more than two decades later , when some other \" life imitating art \" incidents get more attention , we can finally enjoy taxi driver in all its artistic glory . \\n',\n",
       " b'maybe the most important thing about this movie is that it\\'s not handled like the hallmark hall of fame movie of the month , because it very well could have been a manipulative tearjerker , broadcasted on abc on a monday night , starring kelly martin and yasmeen bleeth , respectively . \\nbecause it\\'s not handled like the greatest story ever told is precisely why it\\'s so great . \\nunderneath the to-die-for cinematography , the brilliant acting , and incessantly wonderful direction is a film of modesty , not sure whether or not this story is totally great but with the balls to run with it , tell it in a certain original way . \\nit doesn\\'t merely go from plot point to plot point . \\nit goes from character to character . \\nit obsesses itself with the depth and the style of it all , and makes the story of a world-reknowned cellist who contracts ms and dies prematurely into the story of two sisters , both musicians , who have a totally unique relationship . \\nit\\'s that their relationship is the center of the story that makes this film transcend any cornball , shamelessly tired tearjerker qualities it could have had and makes this , unlike \" patch adams , \" effortlessly emotional and real . \\nin short , this movie is just awesome . \\nit merely tells its story really well , and that\\'s something that just has to be commended these days , when most stories are botched because they\\'re not told by great storytellers . \\ndirector anand tucker tells this story well . \\nhe overdramaticizes everything , but still keeps it real . \\nthe film tells the story of hilary and jacqueline du pr ? ( rachel griffiths and emily watson , respectively ) , two sisters who are first seen in childhood ( played by auriol evans and keely flanders , respectively ) as the very best of friends . \\nthey are also both musicians , hilary a flutist and jackie a cellist , and when it all begins , both are considered child prodigies , but hilary is seen as the better of the two . \\njackie , a bit jealous , works and works at her playing skills , and soon the tables are turned . \\nwhen they both hit adulthood , hilary strives for a comeback , while her sister is playing in famous halls around the world , but instead of fame , captures the heart of a hapless , joyful conductor , kiffer finzi ( david morissey , in a semi-star-making turn ) . \\nthey marry , after a short courtship , and move to a lovely country house , making jackie incredibly jealous since her cello playing becomes a symbol of her current life : when she plays , she has the eyes of the world , but when she stops , she\\'s alone . \\nshe enters into a shallow relationship with an equally famous pianist , daniel barenboim ( james frain ) , in hopes that she may overcloud her sister , but she eventually begins to lose it , and runs away to hilary\\'s country home , where she hopes to gain admittance by hilary to sleep with her husband , since no one she sleeps with gives her any pleasure . \\nit\\'s all terribly melodramtic , as you can see , and by the time jackie has contracted ms ( in a brilliantly edited scene that surpasses the breakdown scene in the semi-smiliar \" shine \" in technical and emotional devastation ) , it would have been the time that i could easily call the sign for melodramatic overload if it hadn\\'t been handled in such a way . \\nthe key thing here is that it\\'s not about her gradual death and slip into insanity but rather that it\\'s about her tumultuous relationship with her sister , which , i might add , is perfectly realized . \\ntheir relationship is the most down-to-earth complex entity of the year : they love eachother more than anyone else in the entire world , but they\\'re also completely jealous of one another . \\nwhen a young jackie surpasses her playing abilities , she tries in vain to make a comeback but can\\'t , and almost seems to marry to get back at jackie for her success . \\nwhen jackie lands on top and sees her sister marry a wonderful man , she is jealous of her lifestyle to the most extensive brinks that i\\'ve ever seen in a film ( only two sisters who truly love eachother would dare share the same man ) . \\nand the whole time , their love for eachother is never doubted or even tested . \\nanother thing i really liked is emily watson\\'s performance . \\ni usually make it a note to never overpraise an actor for playing either a drunkard or a lunatic or someone with a mortal disease ( or any combination of the three ) . \\nmy reasoning for this is that it\\'s a fucking easy job . \\nthe worst case for this very year may be thandie newton in \" beloved \" : sure , she\\'s good , but what\\'s so tough about playing a woman who stumbles around , slurs her words together , and acts like a three year old inside a 20-year old\\'s body ? \\nhell , i could play that if i had a pair of breasts . \\nin that same exact movie , though , is a performance by kimberly elise where she has to be the rock that holds the family together as her mother slowly goes insane , her brothers run off never to be seen again , and her mother\\'s lover is scared off . \\nshe has to actually deal with real emotions , something much harder than mere stumbling about . \\nbut the academy of arts and sciences loves loves loves overpraising performances like newtons . \\nif you don\\'t believe me , look at jack nicholson\\'s performance in \" as good as it gets \" : great performance , but easy job . \\nthis isn\\'t so for watson , though , because her insanity comes from real emotions , not just a plot point . \\nand thanks to the opening sequence , where we see her and hilary as kids , we understand the motives behind all her actions , and by the time she actually contracts ms and begins to loose her sanity and her life , we\\'ve already understood that this is the last straw for a woman plagued with terrible neuroses . \\nrachel griffiths , who would have otherwise been the understudy to watson\\'s protagonist , actually matches watson step-for-step , because as watson grows insane , and demands unspeakable things from her , griffiths holds her own , and has to deal with what she is able to give her sister who needs emotional help from her . \\ngriffiths , an otherwise unknown actress ( and watson being famous from \" breaking the waves \" and \" the boxer \" ) , is absolutely brilliant , just as absolutely brilliant as watson is , and if the academy and all the other critics groups , who\\'ve already deemed watson\\'s performance the best of the year , glance over hers because she\\'s the one who doesn\\'t get to go insane ( read : she gets the boring role ) , then the scream of hysteria you hear will be from me . \\nafter all , griffiths has the thankless job of keeping things real - the tom cruise role in \" rainman \" ( the one who should have gotten oscar consideration and not hoffman ) . \\nshe does , and if anyone deserves accolades from the academy this year , it\\'s griffiths . \\ntogether , the two actresses work extremely well , though , and both have to go through deep emotional hell , the likes of which haven\\'t been seen this year . \\nif it hadn\\'t been for an otherwise not-totally-great final section that deals way too much with jackie and not enough with hilary ( when the two had gotten equal treatment for the entirety ) , i\\'d say this is one of the top ten best films of the year . \\nit\\'s so close to perfection , in its structure , its treatment of its subject , and its beautiful technical specifications ( cinematography nomination , without a shred of doubt in my mind , and maybe film editing ) , that it\\'s nearly a shame that it\\'s not the flawless gem that it should be . \\nbut , hey , as it is , i can hardly complain . \\n',\n",
       " b'whenever writer/director robert altman works in a specific genre , he has the tendency to rewrite it on his own terms . \\nhe made the west dirty in \" mccabe and mrs . miller \" ( 1971 ) , he parodied hard-boiled detective stories in \" the long goodbye \" ( 1973 ) , and he transformed a cartoon into flesh and blood with \" popeye \" ( 1980 ) . \\nthe same holds true for his most recent film , \" the gingerbread man , \" which reinvents a genre that has developed at an exponential rate over the last five years : the john grisham movie . \\nby the time \" the gingerbread man \" was completed , there was very little evidence that it was ever based on a story by grisham . \\nthere\\'s no idealist young lawyer ala tom cruise , matthew mcconaughey , chris o\\'donnell or matt damon , and it doesn\\'t feature a great showdown in a courtroom . \\ninstead of being a grand ode to the powers of the legal profession , \" the gingerbread man \" is a rain-soaked , southern gothic noir thriller with wildly eccentric characters , a twisting plot line , black humor , a somewhat bleak ending , and even altman\\'s trademark full-frontal female nudity . \\nthe central character of the film is rick magruder , who is unlike any of grisham\\'s other lawyer heroes . \\nhe is older , experienced , and rich ; he drives a cherry-red $80 , 000 mercedes that never gets dirty , even in the incessantly pouring rain of savannah , georgia , where the story unfolds . \\nrick is in the midst of an ugly divorce with his wife , leeanne ( famke janssen ) , and he rarely gets to see his two children , jeff ( jesse james ) and libby ( mae whitman ) . \\na reason is never given for the divorce , but it isn\\'t hard to surmise that rick\\'s womanizing had a large part in it . \\nwhenever he\\'s late to pick up the kids on his visitation days , leeanne always assumes it\\'s because he\\'s been \" screwing around . \" \\nafter an office party celebrating another of his court victories ( he hasn\\'t lost in eight years ) , rick becomes involved with mallory doss ( embeth davidtz ) , one of the catering waitresses . \\nhe drives her home because her car has been stolen , and they end up in bed together . \\nrick finds out that mallory is being terrorized and stalked by her slightly psychotic father , dixon doss ( robert duvall ) , a grungy , stringy , bare-footed old man who leads a commune of other greasy old codgers . \\nit was actually dixon who stole her car that night , and when rick asks why , mallory replies that he always does \" weird \" stuff like that . \\nas another character puts it , dixon is \" a few beers short of six-pack . \" \\nrick ends up convincing mallory to have dixon brought to court and tried for competency . \\nhe succeeds with information dug up by clyde pell , a private investigator friend ( robert downey jr . ) , and testimony from mallory\\'s begrudging ex-husband , pete randle ( tom berenger ) . \\ndixon is put in a mental hospital , but his commune buddies succeed in breaking him out . \\nfrom there , the story delves into kidnapping , murder , double-crossing , and even a hurricane that adds an ominous cloud of constant violence to the action . \\naltman\\'s cinematographer , changwei gu , gives the film a dark , soaked look . \\nif it isn\\'t night-time , at least it\\'s raining . \\ngu shoots the interiors , which are almost all dark wood paneling , with a minimum of light . \\na great deal of the action takes place in the leafy georgia backwoods , which altman uses to create an acute sense of dread and vulnerability . \\nin the city there is danger enough , but when rick has to venture into the woods , you can almost feel him leaving all hope of civilization behind as he literally enters another world . \\naltman has worked in just about every conceivable genre , from westerns to epic dramas to comedies . \\nbut , no matter what the genre , he is always sure to give it the altman stamp , which usually consists of all kinds of idiosyncratic quirks and little details that are often missed without repeat viewings . \\n \" the gingerbread man \" is no different , although his style is much more restrained here . \\nhowever , without those little touches , the film could have easily slumped into a routine action/thriller . \\na great deal of the credit for the film\\'s success can be given to the actors , especially branagh , who rarely works outside of period pieces and his own direction . \\nhere , the british actor consistently maintains a serviceable southern drawl , while making an essentially contemptible character interesting and sympathetic . \\nrick is an extremely flawed man , but branaugh brings real humanity to his character . \\nwithout it , the entire film would fall flat because so much of it is reliant on the audience feeling rick\\'s pain and frustration . \\nthe supporting actors also put in fine performances , including embeth davidtz , who is probably best known for her heart-breaking role as the jewish maid in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) . \\ntom berenger provides some gruff comic relief , and robert duvall spends most of his on-screen time just looking weird . \\nit doesn\\'t seem like he does much because he has very little spoken dialogue , but watch him closely during the film\\'s one courtroom scene : his entire performance is in his eyes and his body language , and few actors could have pulled it off without being either silly or overbearing . \\nwhile \" the gingerbread man \" isn\\'t in league with altman\\'s greatest works like \" nashville \" ( 1975 ) or \" the player \" ( 1992 ) , it is nonetheless a solid piece of genre filmmaking , which may prove a successful vehicle to restart his somewhat lagging career . \\nsome critics love to stamp films like this as \" commercial , \" as if altman can only maintain artistic integrity if his films are aimed at a tiny audience and don\\'t make money . \\naltman has done something much better : he took what could have been a generic movie , and by investing artistry and effort , he made it into something more . \\n',\n",

\\nwhy bother saying what year this is . \\njust tell us it\\'s the future . \\ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \\nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \\nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \\nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \\none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \\nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \\nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \\nbut if that\\'s the best part of the movie , i can\\'t in good conscience recommend it . \\nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \\n',\n",

       " b\"the release of dolores claiborne into wide release this weekend adds another entry into the long list of film adaptations of stephen king's work . \\nthis slow-moving character study provides some outstanding acting performances by the principals , but suffers from a tepid conclusion , inconsistent direction , and may not have wide commercial appeal . \\nwhen the maid , dolores claiborne , is found brandishing a rolling pin standing over the bloody and dead body of her employer , it seems like an open-and-shut murder case . \\nupon hearing of the death via a mysterious fax , dolores' estranged and bitter daughter , esquire magazine writer selena st . george , returns from new york back to her tiny island village childhood home . \\nas the two clash horns , the story behind the mysterious death of dolores' abusive husband two decades ago , ruled an accident despite the protests of detective john mackey , is revealed . \\ndid dolores kill her husband ? \\nand did she kill her employer ? \\ndolores claiborne is certainly more of a character study than a suspense thriller . \\nconsequently , it is fortunate that their cast includes some of hollywood's finest character actors , such as bates , leigh and strathairn . \\nkathy bates plays the film's title character , and gives a sensational lead performance . \\ndolores claiborne is essentially a showcase for the talent of bates , as her character has a huge amount of screen time . \\nshe dominates the screen , producing a character that is compelling and arresting , as we watch the character go through two decades of history via flashbacks . \\nkathy bates' performance is award-calibre stuff . \\nthe rest of the cast is also very good . \\njennifer jason leigh plays the perpetually sour , bitter helena st . george well , and christopher plummer seems to be enjoying himself as dolores' ever-present nemesis , the determined detective john mackey . \\ndavid strathairn is particularly interesting and suitably smarmy and despicable as dolores' husband , joe st . george . \\njudy parfitt is fine as dolores' tyrannic socialite employer , vera donovan--it would have been interesting to see , say , meg foster in this role . \\nchild actor ellen muth is also worth noting as the young selena during the flashback sequences ; she is very impressive . \\nthe direction of dolores claiborne by taylor hackford wildly varies throughout the film , ranging from some parts which are quite clever in their own right , to parts which are embarrassingly hokey . \\nthe segues between flashbacks and the present are very hit-and-miss in terms of effectiveness . \\nthe pacing of the film tends to be numbingly slow , which tends to undermine any suspense which might be built up . \\nhowever , the cinematography by gabriel beristain is wonderful--i particularly like the chilling ice-blue hue permeating the present-day scenes , contrasting well with the many nova scotia ocean shots--and danny elfman provides a surprisingly understated score for the film . \\nit would seem that the commercial potential of dolores claiborne is limited . \\nnone of the performers in the film could be classified as a big draw , and its pacing may be a turn-off to those expecting a gripping suspense film filled with twists and turns and car crashes and axe-wielding psychopaths . \\nalthough being essentially the only film in its genre in release now , it may also be hurt by the negative perception of king works , even with the recent critical success of the shawshank redemption and the stand . \\ndolores claiborne suffers from a very unsatisfying conclusion , and moves very slowly . \\nhowever , the performances are uniformly excellent , particularly kathy bates , and the film has its moments . \\non my four-star scale , i give dolores claiborne three stars . \\n\",\n",

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\njames toback\\'s return to directing after a eight-year layoff , two girls and a guy , is a film which is comprised , more or less , of just that : one guy , blake ( robert downey jr . ) ; two girls , carla ( heather graham ) and lou ( natasha gregson wagner ) ; one primary setting ( blake\\'s absurdly spacious bachelor apartment ) , and a great deal of dialogue . \\nembracing a near real-time approach , this is a highly theatrical feature that completely hangs upon the performances of its three actors and the quality of the dialogue written by mr . toback for his bantering characters . \\nfortunately , the film\\'s cast is up to the challenge , and the wordy exchanges between the triad of characters , while admittedly variable , are occasionally wickedly amusing . \\nthe film\\'s setup is fairly generic in nature , and opens rather unpromisingly . \\nwe meet self-possessed blonde carla and feisty brunette lou , both waiting outside a soho loft . \\nas they engage in idle chatter , it is revealed that they\\'re both waiting for their respective boyfriends to return from the airport , and it doesn\\'t take long for them to come to the realisation that they\\'re being two-timed by the same guy . \\nmore indignant with him than catty with each other , the duo break into blake\\'s loft and await his arrival for a confrontation . \\nit\\'s when blake returns to his abode where the film hits its stride . \\nplayed with magnificent bombast by mr . downey jr . , blake is a cad , all right , but a captivatingly dynamic , blusterous , and stealthy piece of work that bursts onto the scene and raises the stakes to new heights . \\nit\\'s fascinating to watch this character in his natural habitat , and perhaps the film\\'s best choice was to have his two girlfriends scamper off into hiding upon his return , allowing us to size up blake not with his interactions with others , but by his own innate behaviour . \\nwhether he\\'s flamboyantly behind his piano in a rollicking rendition of vivaldi , or on the phone leaving messages to his beloveds ( carla , lou , and his unseen sickly mother ) , it\\'s never less than wildly entertaining and insightful . \\nthough at this point i almost hoped the film would transform into a one-man show -- a typical afternoon in the life of blake , if you will -- carla , and then lou , reveal themselves , and the sparks begin to fly . \\n ( one of the great touches in the film is how blake , when startled by carla\\'s unannounced appearance , begins to both verbally and physically backpedal even before he realizes that the cat\\'s out of the bag . ) \\ndouble-teamed by the understandably aggrieved women ( who are more smirkingly inquisitive than ferociously vengeful -- they want a justification for his ongoing hypocrisy ) , an increasingly-flustered blake weakly defends himself with apologetic and even self-righteous declarations against their verbal jabs . \\nsurprisingly delightful in the waltz of scathing witty banter shared by its trio of characters , two girls and a guy concludes its first sequence with an unexpected apoplectic act of such outrageous audacity that it seemed nothing was off-limits for this film . \\nhowever , it\\'d be unfeasible to attempt to string along carla and lou\\'s outrage to full feature-length , and it\\'s as the movie gradually transforms into the sharing of exploratory profundities on the nature of fidelity and relationships that it slowly but surely begins to unravel . \\nthe dialogue becomes less and less engaging and clever , the film\\'s tempo loses its liveliness , the dynamic between the characters evolves in unconvincing fashion , and several sequences fall flat . \\nsubtle and not-quite-subtle allusions are made ( a poster of jules et jim hangs prominently on the wall ) , and secrets are revealed which barrel the film toward an uncompelling weepy finale . \\none key turning point in the film is the kinky sex scene between blake and carla . \\ntwo girls and a guy was embroiled in a bitter , long-running dispute with the mpaa with regards to this scene -- contractually-obligated to deliver an r-rated film , mr . toback was forced to resubmit fourteen scaled-down versions of the steamy interlude before the mpaa withdrew their nc-17 rating in favour of an r -- and while admittedly titillating , the net effect of the vignette on the film\\'s thematic narrative is rather dubious . \\nif anything , two girls and a guy serves as a showcase for the phenomenal talents of mr . downey jr . , whose versatility is put to the test in this film . \\nhe plays the gamut from indignant to humbled , from self-assured to disconcerted , yet his acting gears shift so smoothly as to not be registered . \\nit\\'s a wonderful performance in a role custom-tailored for him ; mr . toback wrote the screenplay in four days shortly after mr . downey jr . was arrested on drug charges , and it\\'s hard not to see echoes of reality seeping into his character -- in a monologue to his mirrored reflection , blake\\'s self-chiding to \" get [his] shit together \" is disquieting in its resonance . \\nwhile mr . downey jr . \\'s showstopping performance is undoubtedly the primary strength of the film , both actresses are solid in more broadly-observed roles . \\nms . graham is quickly becoming one of america\\'s more daring actresses , involving herself in three successive risky projects -- two girls and a guy and boogie nights are both quite sexually frank , while lost in space has a screenplay penned by akiva goldsman . \\nshe\\'s quite appealing here , playing a character at once both dainty and sultry . \\nmeanwhile , ms . gregson wagner initially portrays lou with such an unwarranted spunk that audiences are likely to find it either annoying , or , like me , endearing . \\nshe tones it down substantially as the film progresses , but i found her more fun to watch as the artificially excitable chatterbox . \\nthe film was reportedly shot in eleven days , filmed mostly in sequence , and the resultant artifacts of this rapid shoot are evident throughout . \\ntwo girls and a guy has an agile , spontaneous sort of feel , and one senses that mr . toback encouraged a good deal of improvisation from his three actors . \\nwhile the film could be transposed directly to the stage more or less intact , it doesn\\'t feel constricted ; the expansive apartment setting is well-used to vary the background , and mr . toback allows his camera to wander and linger on his characters in an effective manner . \\ntwo girls and a guy falls short of its potential , but thanks to some stellar work by mr . downey jr . , it\\'s still often an enjoyable , bitingly funny romp , particularly as we watch the surprisingly-resilient blake evasively try to rationalize his behaviour and even turn the tables on his girlfriends . \\n \" i\\'m an actor , \" he tells them at one point , using the ol\\' tried-and-tested occupational-hazard defense . \\n \" actors lie . \" \\nbut not , they all seem to agree , denzel washington . \\n',\n",
       " b'glory--starring matthew broderick , denzel washington , and morgan freeman--is the true story of the 54th regiment of massachusetts , the first black fighting unit recruited by the north during the civil war . \\nbroderick plays robert gould shaw , the young white officer who led the black soldiers into battle . \\nshaw , the son of well-to-do abolitionists , hailed from boston high society . \\nthe letters he wrote home to his parents during the war are on display at harvard , and were , evidently , the inspiration for glory . \\nas the film begins in 1862 , shaw is a captain in the northern forces . \\nlike private eriksson ( michael j . fox ) in casualties of war , shaw initially is naive and idealistic about the war--that is , until his company is attacked by enemy forces . \\nshaw experiences first hand the horror and chaos of battle , witnessing mass slaughter and receiving a minor wound himself when a bullet grazes his neck . \\nsoon after his recovery , shaw is promoted to colonel and assigned to enlist and train blacks in the war effort . \\nglory is the story not only of colonel shaw , but also of the black soldiers who laid down their lives to free their brothers from slavery . \\nthe film periodically jumps between shaw\\'s point of view and the perspective of the black soldiers . \\nthe movie introduces us to a handful of black recruits , and we follow them from their enlistment through basic training and finally into action . \\nthe large black cast is uniformly outstanding , especially washington who is electrifying as a runaway slave with a big mouth . \\nhe is brash and pushy , always getting into trouble and always looking for a fight . \\nhis bitter , tough guy facade is really just a mask for his loneliness and vulnerability . \\nwashington provides much of the film\\'s intensity and emotional power . \\nin one heartbreaking scene , he is whipped for allegedly deserting the army . \\nwhen he removes his shirt to receive the punishment , you cringe at the sight of his back , which is riddled with ugly scars from his days as a slave . \\nit makes your blood boil . \\nthe humiliation of the beating is far more traumatic than the actual physical pain it brings ; a tear rolls down washington\\'s cheek--and will probably run down your cheek as well . \\nthe episode becomes even more tragic when we learn that washington wasn\\'t deserting the army at all ; he left camp to look for shoes because his feet were covered with oozing sores . \\nfreeman is , as usual , a strong presence , even in a small supporting role . \\nhe plays a grave digger who has buried more white soldiers than he cares to remember . \\nhe quickly becomes a leader among the black soldiers , holding the group together and serving as a liaison to the white officers . \\ncolonel shaw recognizes freeman\\'s leadership ability and promotes him to sergeant major , making him the first black officer in the army . \\nandre braugher makes an impressive film debut in the role of thomas searles , a free black who is one of shaw\\'s close childhood friends . \\nsearles is educated and refined , like a white man , prompting washington to nickname him \" snow flake . \" \\nthe burning question is whether searles is tough enough to survive basic training and to kill in combat . \\nthe road from marching drills to battle action is a bumpy one for the black regiment . \\nthe soldiers suffer innumerable hardships , but somehow they never lose their morale . \\nthe army treats the black soldiers like second class citizens , subjecting them to racism and discrimination . \\nthey are paid only $10 a month , whereas their white counterparts earn thirteen , and , for a long time , they have to go without shoes , guns , or uniforms . \\nto make matters worse , the white military hierarchy is extremely reluctant to allow the blacks into action , preferring instead to use them for manual labor . \\neventually , however , the regiment receives its boots , uniforms , rifles , and right to fight , thanks to the stubborn resolve of colonel shaw . \\nshaw has absolute faith in his soldiers , and he fights tooth and nail to get them what they deserve , even if it means threatening a general with blackmail . \\nbroderick , in fact , is most convincing in the scenes where shaw stands up for the regiment . \\nunfortunately , however , broderick\\'s uneven performance is , in many respects , the weak link in the movie . \\nin an effort to look more mature , broderick sports a mustache and a goatee , and throughout the film he slips in and out of a phony boston accent . \\nhe is never altogether convincing as shaw since much of the time his emotions seem forced . \\nthe film places too much weight on broderick\\'s character and not enough on the black soldiers , who are more intriguing . \\nglory regains lost ground with its harrowing depiction of war . \\nthe movie shows the devastation of war without resorting to the unnecessarily graphic gore which marred born on the fourth of july . \\nglory does not try to rattle you with nauseating blood and guts . \\nexcept for a few bullet wounds and one exploding head , the film , for the most part , leaves the gore to your imagination , which is not to say that the battle scenes in glory are timid . \\nto the contrary , they are chaotic and horrifying ; it\\'s just that director edward zwick ( the co-creator of \" thirtysomething \" ) films them with far more subtlety and restraint than oliver stone could ever muster . \\nthe key to glory is the group dynamic among the black soldiers . \\nthe movie depicts some of ( but not enough of ) their customs and rituals . \\nin one scene , for example , the soldiers motivate themselves by singing prayers around the campfire . \\neach man has a chance to relay a few words of inspiration . \\na couple of the movie\\'s most touching moments involve young black children looking up to the black soldiers with awe , disbelief and pride . \\nthe regiment\\'s greatest triumph comes when the soldiers distinguish themselves in battle , thereby earning the respect of their white peers and earning the honor of leading the climactic assault on fort wagner . \\nlike any war film , glory has its share of gloom and despair , but ultimately it proves to be a truly uplifting experience and an important history lesson , a valuable reminder that despite what the history books say ( or , more precisely , what they do not say ) , blacks played a critically important role in the north\\'s victory over the south--forever changing the evolution of america . \\n',\n",

       " b'the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo\\'s own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . \\nthe story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100% factual . \\nplot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant\\'s radical activities . \\nhe is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . \\nramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this \" assignment \" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) \\ncritique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime . \\nadmittedly , i wasn\\'t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn\\'t expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . \\nthe first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . \\nquinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn\\'t offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . \\nsutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they\\'ve played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters . \\ni didn\\'t like performance put forth from quinn\\'s wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn\\'t show up in most of the film , so that wasn\\'t so bad . \\ni did however enjoy director duguay\\'s interesting style and cinematic vision . \\nthis thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . \\ni thought that was neat . \\nhaving said that , i didn\\'t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the \" fake \" jackal met with the \" real \" jackal\\'s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . \\nlittle known facts : ben kingsley\\'s real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 \" 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982\\'s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . \\nmany scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo\\'s haven of restfulness ) . \\ndonald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal . \\n',\n",

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\neast meets west in mulan , the latest installment in disney\\'s parade of annual animated feature films . \\nan odd fusion of ancient asian traditions and disconcerting elements which betray obvious mass-market commercial sensibilities , this confident entry is easily the most engaging and satisfying hollywood animated feature in years , but falls short of actualizing its potential . \\nthough not for lack of trying . \\nin many respects , mulan is among disney\\'s most mature efforts , skirting the surface of adult themes and daring to sneak glimpses into the messier side of combat . \\nthe violence of the battles in the film are admittedly sanitized -- the imagery of a pillaged village , neatly encapsulated in the form of a child\\'s discarded doll , is in itself no more harrowing than luke discovering his fallen guardians in star wars , and mulan\\'s later heroics in dispatching of the ruthless invaders is done so in the most tidy , bloodless method imaginable -- yet how often does a hollywood animated film , long considered as the last safe refuge for the innocent , dare touch upon the consequential horrors of war in such a provocative manner ? \\nin an instant , idealistic mulan\\'s innocence is lost , and her jovial squadron are reminded of what their efforts are spent defending . \\nthe film , based upon an ancient chinese fable , centers on a spirited young woman who disguises herself as a man in order to serve as her family\\'s obligatory conscript when china finds itself under attack by huns ( cartoonishly depicted by easy demonic overtones , replete with glowing yellow eyes and dagger-edged teeth , although lent a surprisingly genuine sense of menace ) . \\ndipping into the mythology of other cultures for the first time after cavorting in animated revisitings of familiar western / european fables and literature for decades , disney\\'s new film is boldly set in ancient china rather than relocated elsewhere , story intact , to some neutral territory , and revels in its east asian roots ; aside from a predominantly asian-american cast providing the film\\'s vocal work , there\\'s liberal usage of oriental iconography throughout , and the artwork reveal hints of japanese anime influence . \\nwhile the film does occasionally reach its limits and starts to tread upon old stereotypes -- invoking pseudo-asian references to items like beancurd and rice in every third sentence grows rather hoary , and i can\\'t imagine that the regiment for ancient chinese warriors * really * included karate-chopping blocks of stone in two -- it\\'s rather remarkable that a movie primarily positioned for american and european audiences delves so wholeheartedly into new foreign territory . \\nthe film also freely touches upon cultural idiosyncrasies from its outset ; although savvy viewers should easily pick up on the intrinsics immediately , it\\'s startlingly assertive in providing as little shorthand as it does to unfamiliar youngsters with regards to the customs and traditions of mulan\\'s land . \\nat its core , the film is a tale of heroic adventure , and as such paints its story in bold strokes of honour , perseverance , nobility and courage . \\nas such , animation is the perfect vehicle for this flavour of epic , where stark emotional simplicity is able to effectively work hand-in-hand with visual purity . \\nscenes which would play out as unbearably hokey in live action , such as mulan\\'s venerable father pridefully tossing aside his cane when accepting his draft notice , are lent a sense of strength and conveyed with greater emotional clarity in animation . \\nmulan capitalizes on this during its strongest moments , particularly during our heroine\\'s character-defining opening half-hour . \\nit\\'s when the film attempts to integrate the traditional mainstays of recent hollywood animation -- the friendly animal sidekick , the colourful array of supporting characters -- into the mix where it goes slightly awry . \\noff to battle , mulan finds herself being trailed by a jive-talking diminutive dragon called mushu and an agreeable little \" lucky \" cricket , who ostensibly appear to assist in her subterfuge and realistically serve as audience-friendly comic relief . \\nthey\\'re affable presences , and not precisely ineffective -- reasonable amounts of humour are elicited , and eddie murphy ( who voices mushu ) is amusingly earnest -- but amidst all the high melodrama , the effect is mildly jarring and , from a storytelling perspective , questionable in its necessity . \\nat training camp , mulan antagonizes and eventually wins over a trio of fumbling recruits ( easily characterized simply as the short clown , the skinny clown , and the big clown ) , who provide more levity into the film with decidedly less effectiveness , and , in a familiar retread of traditional disney patterns , she grows a certain fondness for a handsome , square-jawed young captain , shang . \\neverybody needs love , even ancient chinese warrior princesses , but not necessarily in * this * film . \\nthe romantic angle , which lets the air out of the sails of the story\\'s neo-feminist underpinnings , lacks any genuine spark and plays out like a contractual obligation . \\nanother staple of recent disney animated films , a cache of hummable little ditties , has also obligingly been carried over to mulan but proves to be a decided weakness . \\ncomposed by matthew wilder , none of the handful of tunes are particularly distinguishing , and one -- \" i\\'ll make a man out of you \" ( unimaginatively accompanying a tired montage featuring our crew of characters transforming into lean fighting machines ) -- becomes so grating and hackneyed that it seems almost interminable . \\nonly \" reflections \" , an early ballad of lament , proves to be a song of any consequence , serving as an effective showcase for lea salonga , one of musical theatre\\'s most wondrously pure voices . \\nnonetheless , mulan is an especially appealing piece of work from the disney factory , with a strong narrative arc and pleasant artwork ; the computer-generated stampede of hun warriors charging down a snow mountain is wholly impressive . \\nwhile the blatantly child-friendly elements at times seem incongruous with the remainder of the film , they\\'re not dissuasive and remain fairly enjoyable . \\nbriskly paced with a smart , energetic heroine and filled with high adventure , the film is ultimately most satisfying on the intimate scale of father and daughter . \\n',\n",

       " b\"in the opening shot of midnight cowboy , we see a close-up of a blank movie screen at a drive-in . \\nwe hear in the soundtrack human cries and the stomping of horses' hooves . \\nwithout an image projected onto the screen , the audience unerringly identifies the familiar sound of cowboys chasing indians and can spontaneously fill in the blank screen with images of old westerns in our mind's eye . \\neven without having seen a cowboys and indians movie , somehow the cliched images of them seem to have found their way into our mental schema . \\nbut do cowboys really exist , or are they merely hollywood images personified by john wayne and gary cooper ? \\nexploring this theme , director john schlesinger uses the idea of the cowboy as a metaphor for the american dream , an equally cliched yet ambiguous concept . \\nis the ease at which salvation and success can be attained in america a hallmark of its experience or an urban legend ? \\nmidnight cowboy suggests that the american dream , like image of the cowboy , is merely a myth . \\nas joe buck migrates from place to place , he finds neither redemption nor reward in his attempt to create a life for himself , only further degeneration . \\nduring the opening credits , joe walks past an abandoned theater whose decrepit marquee reads `john wayne : the alamo . ' \\nas joe is on the bus listening to a radio talk show , a lady on the air describes her ideal man as `gary cooper ? but he's dead . ' \\na troubled expression comes across joe's face , as he wonders where have all the cowboys gone . \\nhaving adopted the image of a cowboy since youth , joe now finds himself deserted by the persona he tried to embody . \\njoe's persistence in playing the act of the cowboy serves as an analogue to his american dream . \\nhe romanticizes about making it in the big city , but his dreams will desert him as he is forced to compromise his ideals for sustenance . \\nby the end of midnight cowboy , joe buck loses everything and gains nothing . \\njust as the audience can picture cowboys chasing indians on a blank screen , we can also conjure up scenes from pretty woman as paradigms of american redemption and success . \\nbut how realistic are these ideals ? \\njoe had raped and been raped in texas . \\nthe scars of his troubled past prompt him to migrate to new york , but he does not know that his aspirations to be a cowboy hero will fail him there just as they had in texas . \\nalongside the dream of success is the dream of salvation . \\nthe ability to pack up one's belongings and start anew seems to be an exclusive american convention . \\nschlesinger provides us with strong hints as to joe's abusive and abused past with flashbacks of improper relationships with crazy anne and granny . \\nwe understand that joe adopts the fa ? ade of a cowboy , a symbol of virility and gallantry , as an attempt to neutralize his shame . \\nhe runs from his past only to be sexually defiled this time by his homosexual experiences in new york . \\nin the scene at the diner which foreshadows joe's encounter with the gay student , joe buck spills ketchup on himself . \\nstanding up , we see the ketchup has made a red stain running from the crotch of his pants down his thigh . \\nschlesinger visually depicts the degeneration of joe's virility by eliciting an image of bleeding genitals , signifying emasculation . \\nbeyond the symbol of castration , the scene may also connote the bleeding of a virgin's first sexual encounter , a reference to joe's first homosexual liaison . \\nthe fact that the idea of a bleeding virgin is relegated only to females furthers the imagery of joe's emasculation . \\nit is ironic that joe has trouble prospecting for female clients , but effortlessly attracts men . \\njoe believes his broncobuster getup is emblematic of his masculinity ; new yorkers see his ensemble as camp and `faggot stuff .

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nit\\'s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \\nthe lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \\nsince then , though , disney\\'s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year\\'s hercules successively proving less and less potent . \\nwith the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox\\'s anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \\nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \\nthe film\\'s storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \\nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \\nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she\\'s resolutely smitten , and she\\'s such a pure and endearing character that one can\\'t help but invest their heart with her . \\nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \\none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \\nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams\\' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \\nwhile it\\'s understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto\\'s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia\\'s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it\\'s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \\ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \\nis the film\\'s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \\n ( i\\'m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \\nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \\nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film\\'s heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \\n ( she\\'s the only reason i\\'d even consider catching flubber . ) \\nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \\nhe easily milks his lovable character\\'s comic moments for all they\\'re worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid\\'s big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . \\npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars\\' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel\\'s father , king triton . \\nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \\nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman\\'s untimely death . \\nnot only are mr . menken\\'s tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman\\'s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film\\'s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character\\'s dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \\nmr . menken\\'s score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken\\'s fine score . \\nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson\\'s heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film\\'s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \\nduring the song\\'s reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \\nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney\\'s limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \\nthere\\'s no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film\\'s reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney\\'s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox\\'s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \\nin every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film\\'s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film\\'s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney\\'s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \\nbut although disney\\'s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \\nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it\\'s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \\nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney\\'s modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \\n',\n",

the city \" misses equaling the greatness of its best picture nominated predecessor babe , it is a worthy companion piece . \\nmore than that , it is a spectacular work of art that deserves to stand alone in its own right . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" warrants the classification of being recognized with such classics like \" the godfather : part ii \" and \" the empire strikes back \" as being one of the greatest sequels ever produced . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" picks up precisely where \" babe \" left off . \\nhaving won the sheep herding competition , farmer hoggett ( james cromwell ) and his pig are elevated to fame status . \\na series of unfortunate circumstances and hilariously freakish events leads to mrs . hoggett taking babe from the small country farm into the big city . \\nin doing so , the film transports us into a wonderfully imaginative world that simultaneously mirrors and exceeds the creative design seen in the original . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" flourishes where so many sequels fail . \\nmost sequels simply rehash the events of the first film . \\nnot \" babe : pig in the city \" . \\nthis is a completely original tale that offers up a story drastically different than the first . \\nalso , by not being content to utilize most of the old characters , this film gives us many new ones to enjoy . \\nin essence , it doesn\\'t attempt to copy itself . \\ninstead , it strives to achieve an originality of its own . \\nand it succeeds . \\nthat\\'s not to say the familiar is absent . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" retains some of the best core elements and characters from the first film . \\nalong with babe himself , ferdinand the duck comes along for the ride , as does mrs . hoggett ( one of this decade\\'s best and most underappreciated comic characterizations , hilariously performed by magda szubanski ) . \\nthe three singing mice also make the journey , chiming in with their cute high-pitched vocals . \\nthe story structure is also similar as each segment is introduced with title cards read by the aforementioned mice . \\nfrom there , we are guided once again by roscoe lee browne\\'s soothingly deep narrative . \\ncomposer nigel westlake also returns with his whimsical music style that is perfect for cinematic fables such as these . \\nbut these elements are simply the frame that surrounds an entirely new painting . \\nwhile staying at the flealands hotel , babe encounters a veritable ark-full of new animals . \\nmonkeys , kittens , and dogs of various breeds and sizes are some of the new \" urbanites \" that babe befriends , as well as some wonderfully comical pelicans that ferdinand the duck happens to encounter . \\neach character is distinctly unique , some of which are imbued with personal human-like struggles that are endearing and touching . \\nand while this world focuses largely on these animals , we are introduced to two new human characters as well . \\nmary stein plays the owner of the flealands hotel , an animal-loving young spinster who harbors these lost creatures much to the dismaying anger of her fellow neighbors . \\nstein\\'s landlady is a wonderfully odd caricature . \\nwe also meet fugly floom , an old soft-spoken clown who owns many of the animals in the flealands hotel , utilizing them as a part of the act that he performs at different parties and functions .

the actor\\'s identity here . \\nit was a treat indeed to see one of cinema\\'s legends grace the screen again in what was a superbly gentle and heartwarming performance . \\nthe greatest triumph of \" babe : pig in the city \" is the art direction . \\nsimply put--it bleeds creativity , taking the look of the original film to a whole new level . \\nrestricted primarily to a farm the first time around , this second installment creates an entire city , dazzling us with unique fable-like architecture . \\nbut the stroke of pure genius by production designer roger ford is his use of our world\\'s architectural landmarks . \\ndesigning a skyline that includes the statue of liberty , the sydney opera house , the brooklyn bridge , the hollywood sign and the eiffel tower , ford has created a singular city that encompasses all of our cities ( as seen in the film photo and pre-production drawing to your right ) . \\nadded to that , many of this city\\'s streets are the twin siblings of venice\\'s gondola-trekked rivers . \\nthe metropolis that has sprung from ford\\'s vision is a wondrous sight to behold . \\nit is a world that you want to walk around in . \\nnorma moriceau\\'s costume designs belong in this world , vibrant in color and style equal to that of the ford\\'s landscape . \\nmost of the costumes are imaginatively cartoonish , with the most exotically grand design going to that of fugly floom\\'s clown outfit . \\nandrew lesnie\\'s photography captures these elements with various lighting moods that are beautifully effective in creating the film\\'s multiple emotional tones . \\nmuch press fodder has been made over the weeks leading up to the release of \" babe : pig in the city \" . \\nreports stated that its original cut was branded with a pg-13 rating . \\nthese reports were discovered to be false as it was assigned a pg rating . \\nbut even so , to be anything harsher than the original\\' s g rating had many parents and fans up in arms . \\nby deleting a minimal number of shots , \" babe : pig in the city \" was eventually given the coveted g rating . \\nalthough appeased , many fans were still concerned that it would be too dark , fearing that the film may have come to be possessed by tim burton himself . \\nwell , to coin a phrase , the reports of \" babe : pig in the city \" \\'s death at the hands of a dark , scary , felliniesque interpretation have been greatly exaggerated . \\ngranted it has its moments of pseudo-morbidity , but all-in-all \" babe : pig in the city \" is the funny and charming adventure that everyone was hoping it would be . \\nwhatever \" dark \" moments it may have can be attributed to director george miller ( the \" mad max \" trilogy , \" the witches of eastwick \" , \" lorenzo\\'s oil \" ) . \\nhaving served as a producer and co-writer on the first film , miller moves into the director\\'s chair for this one , putting his own unique sense of style into this budding franchise . \\nthe story of \" babe : pig in the city \" is an enchanting yarn , but one that doesn\\'t achieve the emotional or character depth of the original . \\nmissing here is the attempt to broach such heady themes as personal identity , an individual\\'s worth , challenging conformity , and one\\'s purpose in life . \\n \" babe \" dealt with this weighty subject matter , creating a timeless fable . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" should not have rehashed these themes , but i do wish it would have attempted to explore new ones . \\nthis film is not bereft of moral or message as it parallels such issues as urban strife , class differences , sacrificial courage , and so on . \\nbut this film\\'s goals aren\\'t as lofty as the first\\'s , instead choosing to take a more straightforward approach , allowing its themes to take a back seat to an exciting , sometimes intense , fable adventure that is undeniably clever and inventive . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" also decides against developing a relationship to the level of which was present in the first film , specifically the one between farmer hoggett and babe . \\nhoggett\\'s love for babe , which grew ever so gently , is what gave that film its charming and endearing quality . \\nbest exemplified in hoggett\\'s dance for babe , this moving relationship was truly unique . \\nit is something that i wish would have been present again ( and could have through fugly floom ) , but was not . \\nplease understand , these are not negative criticisms , per se\\' , but simply statements of what i see as the differences between \" babe : pig in the city \" being a very good film and the original being a great one . \\nbut having said that , these observations are minor critiques at best . \\nas an overall piece , \" babe : pig in the city \" is a thoroughly enchanting and entertaining fable from beginning to end . \\nsure , it isn\\'t a great film , but it is an excellent one that possesses elements of greatness . \\nit is a film that is magical with its charm and humor , exciting in its adventurous exploits , funny with its dry wit and cute voices , and breathtaking in its presentation . \\n \" babe : pig in the city \" may not be moviemaking at its absolute best , but it is on level of cinematic quality that is rarely achieved or seen in cinema . \\nas a result , if you choose to let this film pass you

\\nwhat was once so powerful about labute\\'s work , the casual , nonchalant cruelty and selfishness ( often elements we all have in us amplified to a disgusting degree ) had become so over the top it was borderline comic . \\nobviously , at this point , labute could use a dose of some different kind of material before he pigeon holes himself further , but nurse betty isn\\'t it . \\nhe clearly has little passion for what he\\'s doing here , instead replacing his mojo with strained quirks ( one of the hit men is a huge soap fan , and the character of betty would be little more than a one joke gimmick if zelllweger hadn\\'t managed to transcend that ) tailor made to appeal to the widest possible audience . \\nnearly every scene between chris rock and morgan freeman fatally slows the picture down , as the two are made to enact soft-boiled tarantino-esque dialogue . \\nthey evince little chemistry , with rock constantly in over the top rant mode , acting more like an angry comic than any thing resembling a hit man ( an occupation that\\'s represented far too frequently in movies nowadays ) . \\ni think rock is a great comic yet he hasn\\'t been able to bring his feral intelligence to movies , whenever he acts , and no matter the part , it\\'s like he\\'s doing the damn chris rock show . \\nsurprisingly ( at least considering her work in me , myself and irene ) renee zellweger gives a revelatory performance , building on her baby faced , apple pie looks . \\nthat wide-open face and helium voiced earnestness suggests a little girl not fully grown into her thirty-year-old body . \\nit\\'s the best work she\\'s ever done . \\nfreeman is effective as always , though his performance nonetheless suffers because it seems at odds with where the movie wants to take it . \\nthe actor plays the role in his usual calm , collected manner , though the flick tries to insinuate a symbolic kinship between his character and betty\\'s , suggesting that both are controlled by their fantasies rather than reality . \\nthat\\'s interesting but the movie doesn\\'t do anything with it other than crash land the sub-theme into a labored speech in the midst of a badly staged gun battle . \\nthe film has good moments ( many of the scenes involving a very good greg kinnear , especially his confrontation with zellweger ) , an almost soothing , lyrical score ( and you know a movie\\'s in trouble when the score sticks out as one of the best things about it ) but nothing jells , it\\'s parts , good or bad , are so disparate as to be opposing . \\nthe film might have worked had it settled on being one type of film , a mainstream , female forrest gump or an oddball art film , but as both if it falls as flat as diet coke . \\nbetty\\'s screenplay makes the mistake of relying too much on concurrence , without which betty wouldn\\'t make any progress in the film . \\nnurse betty is a film driven by coincidence rather than charter , like how betty becomes a nurse in the film , a job that she takes in order to get closer to her imaginary lover ; she happens to be at the hospital at the exact moment that a drive by shooting takes place and miraculously knows how to take care of the victim\\'s wound because she happened to see how on tv , which leads to her being offered a room with the victim\\'s girlfriend who eventually gets betty into a party where she meets kinnear ? ? ? a little too tidy , don\\'tcha think . \\nbetty has an interesting theme , though it doesn\\'t even seem aware of this . \\nthe current state of tv has been leaning towards reality television what with the enormous success of survivor and moderate success of big brother , with more on the way . \\nthis is a film about a women so deluded as to think that her favorite soap opera is reality ( ironically real-life survivor sean kennif has taken a part as a doctor on the soap opera guiding light ) . \\ninstead of exploring this timely matter in a way relating to the current tv craze ( since the film does largely appear to be a satire of television , albeit one that would feel more appropriate in the \\'80s than the \\'00s ) , the film simply uses betty\\'s delusions as a plot device to get her from point a to b . no progress is made and little is unearthed except that maybe labute could use a bit of rest and a lot of contemplation . \\n',\n",
       " b'a backdrop of new year\\'s eve in 1981 would seem to lend itself to a great party movie . \\nthe decor possibilities are endless - disco balls had yet to migrate into the dark corners of the attic , big hair was worth its weight in aquanet , and the louder the fashion , the better the look . \\nbut despite this setting , these details and a soundtrack that includes some 40-plus irresistible hits from the early days of the me decade , something is inherently wrong with \" 200 cigarettes . \" \\na better title for this nostalgic mess would be \" 50 missed opportunities . \" \\nwhat is it that makes this retro-comedy such a downer ? \\nit\\'s certainly not the cast , which includes enough hot , young talent for several movies . \\nthere\\'s courtney love , cementing her reputation as a serious actress ; christina ricci , hot off her shoulda-been-nominated turn in \" the opposite of sex \" ; paul rudd , who gets even more appealing with every role ; kate hudson , inheriting some fine acting genes from mom goldie hawn ; and affleck brothers ben and casey , two of the best things about \" good will hunting . \" \\nperhaps the question is this : what drew these and other immensely talented actors to such a dreary project ? \\nmaybe it looked good on paper . \\n \" 200 cigarettes \" is composed of a series of vignettes , as various characters make their way through new york\\'s festively decorated east village to a holiday bash thrown by a jittery bundle of nerves named monica ( martha plimpton , all dressed up in her best cyndi lauper ) . \\namong the potential guests are likeable cad kevin ( rudd ) and his best friend lucy ( love ) , busy bickering over his recent break-up , and a clumsy but seemingly charming bartender ( ben affleck ) who opens his mouth only to spew forth bad pick-up lines . \\nmore subplots - _many_ more - dot the big picture , but those listed above are the only ones worth noting in a positive light . \\nall the other story tangents are as frazzled as a cokehead trying to solve a rubick\\'s cube . \\nricci and gaby hoffman grate as two ronkonkoma gals ( the kind that have trouble pronouncing hard consonants ) out to have a high time in the big city . \\ninfamously acerbic comedienne janeane garofalo is wasted in what amounts to a several-scene cameo . \\nhudson , as a pretty-in-pink klutz recently devirginized by a reprehensible ladies\\' man ( jay mohr ) , trips , pukes and gets smeared with dog poop . \\nare we laughing yet ? \\nthe film boils down to a mixture of the good , the bad and the gaudy , with the latter two overtaking the former . \\ngame performances - especially by love , rudd and plimpton - are almost shot down by the bizarrely colorful parts and a constantly roving focus , here a combination that mostly sputters when it should crackle . \\ntoo many sidetracks rate as uninteresting and have little payoff until a lengthy final montage where we find out many of the performers served as one night stands for each other . \\nif this is \" 200 cigarettes , \" then get me 200 nicotine patches . \\n',\n",
       " b\"i love movies . \\ni really do . \\nevery time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 ) , a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent , skill and entertainment that is on display . \\neven lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made , are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value . \\nthen there's my favourite martian , the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried , poorly written and acted movie with one goal , to make money . \\ndisney , ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch , but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk . \\nchristopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporter's tim o'hara car ( daniels ) , and soon tim finds the martian in his home , trying to recover and fix his spaceship . \\nalong with his 'zoot' spacesuit , voiced by wayne knight , must fix his spaceship before it explodes , and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public , firstly by o'hara , but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley ) , by calling himself tim's 'uncle martin . ' \\n'laughter' is supposed to arise from the 'comical' events , but never does . \\nmany bad films have good intentions , but my favourite martian doesn't appear to try to provide any entertainment . \\nfilled to the brim with wham bang special effects , my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy . \\nchristopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie , i've never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now . \\njeff daniels plays 'staple nice guy' and his role is useless . \\nhis performance is incredibly lazy , although his paperthin character doesn't deserve more than the performance he gives . \\ndarryl hannah looks as pretty as ever , but her role is somewhat , erm , limited . \\nhurley mistakes 'acting' for 'shouting and looking like a twit' and wins the david wilcock award for 'most irritating , godawful performance in a moving picture . ' \\nway to go liz ! \\nfor the supporting cast , disney manage to assemble every character actor out there , during the film i was going 'he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . . ' \\nbefore finally giving up and switching off . \\nanother major setback is the staple 'comedy sidekick . ' \\nunfortunately , the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver , if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be 'funny . ' \\ninstead , they deliver zoot , the martians deeply unfunny sidekick . \\nalthough meant to be a manic character no doubt , every line that comes out of his 'neck' is a dud . \\na real dud . \\ncitizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester . \\neven the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk . \\nit's a nice special effect , though . \\nanother problems with this comedy are the gags themselves . \\nor rather , the lack of them . \\nmy favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl , down the pipe and into the sewer . \\nnow , toilet humour can be funny , as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed . \\nbut here , characters farting , belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not 'amusing . ' \\nit's insulting . \\nthere's one good gag right before the credits , but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued . \\neither that , or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldn't mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes . \\nyes , men at work . \\nyowza ! \\nthe fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film , and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more . \\nthere are thousands of brilliant films out there that can't get distribution , yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease . \\nthankfully , as soon as it makes it's money , it will never be seen again , and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet . \\n\",\n",
       " b'that\\'s exactly how long the movie felt to me . \\nthere weren\\'t even nine laughs in nine months . \\nit\\'s a terrible mess of a movie starring a terrible mess of a man , mr . hugh grant , a huge dork . \\nit\\'s not the whole oral-sex/prostitution thing ( referring to grant , not me ) that bugs me , it\\'s the fact that grant is annoying . \\nnot just adam sandler-annoying , we\\'re talking jim carrey-annoying . \\nsince when do eye flutters and nervous smiles pass for acting ? \\nbut , on the other hand , since when do really bad slapstick ( a fistfight in the delivery room culminating in grant\\'s head in joan cusack\\'s lap--a scene he paid $60 to have included in the movie ) and obscene double entendres ( robin williams , the obstetrician , tells grant\\'s pregnant girlfriend she has \" a big pussy , \" referring of course to the size of the cat hairs on her coat , but nonetheless , grant paid $60 to have the exchange included in the movie ) pass for comedy ? \\nnine months is a predictable cookie-cutter movie with no originality in humor or plot . \\nhugh grant plays a successful child psychiatrist . \\nwhy a child psychologist ? \\nso the scriptwriters could inject the following unfunny exchange : \\nkid : my dad\\'s an asshole . \\ngrant ( flutters eyelashes , offers a nervous smile , then responds in his annoying english accent and i-think-i-actually-have- talent attitude ) : could you possibly elaborate on that ? \\nkid : my dad\\'s a _huge_ asshole . \\nmore like a hugh asshole , but that\\'s beside the point , which is : nine months includes too many needlessly stupid jokes that get laughs from the ten year olds in the audience while everyone else shakes his or her head in disbelief . \\nso , anyway , grant finds out his girlfriend is pregnant and does his usual reaction ( fluttered eyelashes , nervous smiles ) . \\nthis paves the way for every possible pregnancy/child birth gag in the book , especially since grant\\'s equally annoying friend\\'s wife is also pregnant . \\nthe annoying friend is played by tom arnold , who provides most of the cacophonous slapstick , none of which is funny , such as a scene where arnold beats up a costumed \" arnie the dinosaur \" ( you draw your own parallels on that one ) in a toy store . \\nthe only interesting character in the movie is played by jeff goldblum , who should have hid himself away somewhere after the dreadful hideaway , as an artist with a fear of ( and simultaneous longing for ) commitment . \\nnot even robin williams , who plays a russian doctor who has recently decided to switch from veterinary medicine to obstetrics , has much humor . \\nhis is a one-joke character-- the old foreign-guy-who-mispronounces-english stereotype ( did someone say yakov smirnov ? \\nthat\\'s my favorite vodka , by the way ) , hence the line \" now it\\'s time to take a look at your volvo , \" another nasty but unamusing joke , except this one goes right over the ten year olds\\' heads , while the adults simultaneously groan . \\nnine months is a complete failure , low on laughs and intelligence and high on loud , unfunny slapstick , failed jokes and other uninspired lunacy . \\nhugh grant\\'s sunset boulevard arrest ( please , no caught-with-his-pants-down jokes ) may bring more people into the theaters , but they certainly won\\'t leave with a smile on their faces , not after 90 minutes of grant\\'s nervous smiles . \\neverything in the movie is so forced , so unauthentic that anyone with an i . q . \\nover 80 ( sorry , hugh ) will know they wasted their money on an unfulfilled desire . \\nbut at least they didn\\'t spend 60 bucks for it . \\n',\n",
       " b\"capsule : a ham-handed and over/underwritten morality play masquerading as entertainment , so muddled it doesn't even know what it's really advocating , if anything . \\na time to kill has been hailed as the best of the grisham adaptations , and it's easy to see why : it presents a strong , almost rancorously so , story ; it is full of good actors ( samuel l . jackson , matthew mcconaughey , sandra bullock , kevin spacey , charles dutton ) ; and it's ostensibly about some important social issue that we're all tangling with . \\nit is not , however , a good movie , and all of the reasons i've listed above have something to do with why . \\nright from the beginning , the movie is dead-set on stacking its deck as thoroughly and unrepentantly as possible . \\na pair of redneck whites , boozed and drugged out of their minds , kidnap a young black girl , abuse and rape her horribly , and leave her for dead . \\nafter their arrest , their father ( jackson ) takes an assault rifle and guns them down on the way to trial . \\nmcconaughey is then drafted in as his lawyer , and the rest is somehow strangely predictable courtoom movie dramatics . \\nthe acting is not quite what it should be , given the cast we have . \\nsandra bullock ( who is a good actress but not a serious one ) looks clueless ; spacey's accent switches itself on and off at random ( and he's given a totally thankless role to play as well , a role without an iota of depth ) ; and mcconaughey's role is stamped from the cardboard back of a cereal box . \\nthe most memorable role is donald sutherland's , and his is a bit part . \\ni always consider it an index of a movie's desperation when it is able to present shocking and outlandish events , and somehow not have them generate an ounce of impact . \\nthere is one scene -- a riot outside the courtroom -- that should have created incredible tension , but winds up playing out like a textbook exercise on how not to deploy a scene like this . \\nbecause the movie doesn't know what it's really about , it * can't * generate any genuine tension , and so it has to artifically inject tension through clumsy plotting . \\none of the ways it does this is by throwing in a whole subplot about a bunch of vicious kkk cross-burners -- which is tidied up so neatly that it borders on the nihilistic . \\ni was reminded of the despicable betrayed , which tried to tart up a fundamentally empty story by injecting vile , graphic acts of racism as little more than an attention-getter . \\nthe movie immolates an enormous amount of its potential by making a few critical mistakes . \\nfirst of all , the jackson character is not hard to judge ; there's no tension in his dilemma . \\nhe's self-admittedly guilty and should be sent to jail , no matter how moral his crusade . \\nthe old saw about how no court in the land would convict him , if he was white , is supposed to be the underlying theme of the movie , but it's never developed into an organic component of the story . \\nit just sort of floats around on top while the movie grinds away furiously with its plot mechanics . \\nanother mistake is in motivational logic : by not having the two white thugs arraigned first -- or maybe tried and then dismissed from lack of evidence , say -- we have that much less empathy for jackson's character . \\ni'm probably supposed to think that just because he had his daughter raped , we are * automatically * supposed to feel empathy for him , but that's precisely the kind of facile thinking that makes real justice impossible . \\n ( see the virgin spring for more on that note . ) \\nis jackson's character then simply insane ? \\nthat prospect isn't given terribly serious treatment either . \\none of the most aggravating things about coutroom movies is how little they seem to know about how the law works , or how lawyers get their information . \\nmcconaughey's character makes an important slipup late in the movie , when one of his witnesses turns out to have been convicted of a capital offense . \\nhow did the prosecution get this information ? \\nhow come he didn't get it ? \\nthe whole way these questions get handled are symptomatic of the movie's way of dealing with complex legal and moral questions in cheap screenwriterly slam-bang fashion . \\nthis is the biggest problem : the movie isn't about jackson's character , or his dilemma , or this case , or any of its ( frequently interesting despite the porcine writing and direction ) characters . \\nit's not ultimately about anything at all , except its stupid geared-down plot , which inches onwards in one unremarkable scene after another towards a totally contrived ending . \\nat two and a half hours , the movie is overlong and drastically overwritten : there's endless stuff about things which ultimately add up to nothing , and no writing about the material that should really matter . \\nit's all handwaving . \\nthe closing argument are also sneaky and underhanded , and underscored my suspicion that the movie is manipulative and unfair . \\nit's not easy to make a movie about something . \\nthe other day i saw kurosawa's phenomenal rashomon , a movie that is really about the way people deal with truth and reality ( or don't ) . \\na time to kill is as empty and ponderous a movie as i've seen in a long time . \\n\",\n",

' \\nthese turn out to be very wise words . \\n8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution . \\nthe set-up is slick and well played , as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her . \\nthis is where everything goes awry . \\nalthough director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world' , he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula . \\neverything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless , repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects . \\nalthough it had enormous potential , the third act of 8mm is a total bust , leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control . \\ncage is the film's sole flame of energy . \\nhis performance is actually believable , but soon the director's demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation . \\nstill , you've got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did , for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand . \\nwelles' trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry . \\nthis is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase , in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film . \\nhe tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer ) , and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery , a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie . \\nwritten by andrew kevin walker , 8mm dissipates into a poor man's seven , with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece . \\nfurthermore , what has become of joel schumacher ? \\nthe director has recently experienced a major drought , slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin , anyone ? ) . \\nthis putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career , so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side . \\n\",\n",

\" \\nanymore ) , and none of the scenes have any degree of wit . \\nthis picture is not inspired , and most scenes flop from one to the other , with no sense of momentum or energy . \\nthe blame for this can be placed on director david nutter , who apparently likes his films dry . \\nhorror films should at least exploit violence , but this one is shockingly timid . \\nthere are a few good scenes , though , such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is , however , the most forced scene in the film , for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) . \\ni also liked the school janitor character , played by william sadler . \\nhe has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking . \\nthe acting is largely a waste of talent . \\nmarsden is , as i said , bland ( thought not particularly bad ) . \\nbruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted . \\nstahl and holmes both show they have talent , but the direction isn\\'t good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahl\\'s performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) . \\nnone of these characters expand beyond their one dimension , and , frankly , watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isn\\'t all that cool . \\ndisturbing behavior is a wreck of a film , and it started out a wreck before shooting even began . \\ni\\'m surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film , or that it would make a lot of money at the box office . \\nit\\'s not boring , or even blatantly awful , but it\\'s an uninspired lump of a film . \\nit sure starts off nicely , but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable . \\nso , if you go to see this film , take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence , and pray it never ends . \\n',\n",

rudimentary plot holes or cliches and it derives a masterful , titillating climax that by it's finale , engrosses a viewer with total absorption . \\nthe plot is somewhat reminiscent of 1988's the

good vs evil , and rooting for the good guys , in this case jeff . \\nkurt russell is one of the few top-notch hollywood actors which doesn't overblow his acting , and gradually gains reliance on his role as it progresses . \\nso you can assume his alteration in breakdown is letter-perfect . \\nsuffice it is to say he undergoes a transformation , from a jolly man , to a guy frantically pursuing a loved one . \\nnot many well-paid actors can deliver these type of performances , but russell is one of them . \\nas an everyday man , he pulls it off extremely convincingly , what also surprised me more was his rigorous physicality , which he effectively practices almost all throughout the films 93 minutes . \\nalthough the film is blotted with a couple of portentous action sequences ( very well done ) yet the tightness is generated by the subtle circumstances this man is presented with . \\nfaced with an enigma about his wife's whereabouts , the movie succeeds by conveying us in realistic territory with veritable characters , including the cryptic villains , who in essence , make the movie what it is . \\nwhat's most impressive however , is the feature debut by writer/director jonathan mostow . \\nmostow , hitherto directed the showtime thriller flight of a black angle , alleviates the contrivances and generics of the script by gingerly pursuing the trajectory of the plot , efficiently letting the tone and the mood of the story generate that nail-biting suspense sought for in a well- made affair . \\ncontrary to most american thrillers , he doesn't rely on visual flair , but on aesthetics and substance . \\nafter breakdown , he should gain vast notoriety . \\nthe villains in the movie aren't your routine out-of-this-world idiosyncratic psychos that are harming for no particular objective . \\nthe baddies in breakdown , all well acted , are normal , seemingly inoffensive townspeople who beneath their trustworthy layer , conduct an amoral business of corruption and murder . \\nthe movie smartly portrays these men as loathsome rednecks , and , of all things in the world , it is becoming rather easy to root for villains ( jon voight in anaconda ) in today's movies . \\nworth a special mentioning is j . t walsh ( who previously worked with kurt russell in executive decision ) as the leader of the gang , he renders a deliciously wicked performance , temporarily stepping out of the minor roles he is known for . \\nalfred hitchcock used suspense--and action-- not only to stimulate , but as a way of aiding his audience's fascination in his stories , which were slowly realizing man's biggest fears . \\nbreakdown yields exactly that . \\nit magnificently taps into the psyche of an ordinary man , acting like an ordinary man , looking like an ordinary and some sort of superhero . \\ndespite one or two iffy moments even hitchcock , i think , would approve of breakdown . \\n ( 1 : 33 ) \\n\",\n",

       " b'since 1990 , the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style . \\nnow , instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues , the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow . \\nthis realist tendancy can be inspiring at times , as 1993\\'s schindler\\'s list shows . \\nmost of today\\'s mainstream drama , however , creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience . \\nthat\\'s why pictures like october sky , which are a throwback to the good ol\\' dramas of yesteryear , are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema . \\nthe movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal ) , a teenager in the 1950\\'s company town of coalwood , west virginia . \\nit\\'s a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine . \\nthe mine , which is run by homer\\'s father ( chris cooper ) , is not the place for homer , however . \\nafter watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957 , homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it , \" anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did . \" \\ndrafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast , homer begins to construct rockets . \\nwith the help of their history teacher , miss riley ( laura dern ) , and several mine workers , the four are soon bound for great things . \\noctober sky is a skillfully crafted film , and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston . \\njohnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what he\\'s doing here . \\nhe molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust . \\nhe does not push any barriers , but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the film\\'s charm . \\nhis finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers , or the silent struggle between homer\\'s mother and father . \\nthe cast is well chosen , although the true bright spots are the supporting roles . \\nlaura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher , giving the boys the support and guidance they need . \\nher role is instantly likeable . \\nchris cooper ( the horse whisperer ) , as homer\\'s father , is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie . \\nhe\\'s definitely a driving force in homer\\'s life , and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable . \\nthe script is generally cheerful , projecting the boys\\' endeavors in a lighthearted manner . \\nthere are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist . \\nit highlights the essence of youth , however , and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps . \\noctober sky should be a success with audiences . \\nalthough it doesn\\'t have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or she\\'s all that , it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards . \\nit\\'s a welcome change to the dramatic genre , and one that everyone should see . \\n',\n",
       " b'tectonic plates is an incredibly painful motion picture experience that nearly prompted me to walk out 20 minutes into the movie . \\nthe film ( which opened in canada during 1992 but was never released in the united states ) is based on a 1988 stage play by canadian auteur robert lapage , and , while it\\'s evident that this could be a fascinating live production , the translation to the screen is a creative disaster . \\nenduring tectonic plates is like sitting through a filmed version of performance art -- lifeless and tedious . \\nthe qualities that make it captivating when seen in person are effaced in the motion picture medium . \\ntectonic plates has a storyline , although the narrative is developed in a decidedly non-traditional fashion , with shots of the stagebound play intercut with more typical cinematic sequences . \\nit\\'s not an inherently uninteresting way to present a movie ( despite the valid complaint that it is pretentious , all-but-screaming , \" look ! \\nart ! \" ) , \\nalthough it keeps the audience distanced from the characters . \\nbecause we\\'re constantly made aware that we\\'re watching a play or a movie , it\\'s impossible to accept these individuals as anything more than mouthpieces for the writer\\'s ideas . \\nthey\\'re not real , sympathetic , or believable . \\ni\\'m willing to give director peter mettler credit for trying something different , but this particular experiment is not a success . \\ntectonic plates opens by introducing us to madeleine ( marie gignac ) , an art student studying in montreal who has fallen in love with her professor , jacques ( lapage ) . \\none day , he disappears , and , fearing that he left because she was undeserving of his love , madeleine travels to venice to kill herself . \\nwhile preparing to commit suicide , she encounters drug addict constance ( celine bonnier ) , who causes madeleine to re-think her decision . \\nmeanwhile , jacques has moved to new york city , where he starts cross-dressing , calls himself jennifer , and becomes a successful counter-culture talkshow host . \\nwith settings that shift from paris to venice to montreal to manhattan to scotland , supporting characters that include a topless goddess and a deaf/mute , and cultural references that point to chopin , george sand , and jim morrison , tectonic plates is unique , if nothing else . \\nhowever , as interesting as the film sounds ( and i was excited to see it because the synopsis is promising ) , it never really delivers . \\nthe tone is soporific , the supposedly-intellectual prattle is inane and uninteresting , the plot meanders in a pointless and irritating manner ( although it doesn\\'t take long for the viewer to determine that the story is largely unimportant ) , and the symbolism is obvious . \\ntectonic plates is trying to show that human interaction is as volatile as unpredictable as the shifting of the earth , but it takes one-hundred minutes to get across this transparent point . \\nthere are some worthwhile moments , such as a silly sword fight between jacques and the topless goddess and an entertaining discussion in both french and english about the differences between the two languages ( although the fine points will certainly be lost on those who aren\\'t bilingual ) . \\nthe only people likely to enjoy tectonic plates are those who feel a strong need to praise something this rootless and boring because ( a ) it\\'s different , ( b ) it\\'s not like anything they\\'ve seen before , and ( c ) it\\'s pretentious . \\nfor everyone else , it\\'s not only a waste of time , but a poor introduction to the work of robert lapage . \\n',\n",

       " b\"the laserman : somehow the title of writer-director-producer peter wang's film conjures up images of superheroes , like ultraman and spiderman . \\nyou kind of expect an adventure flick about a crime fighter who can shoot laser beams from his fingertips . \\nas it turns out , the laserman _is_ about crime and about laser beams , but there aren't any superheroes . \\ninstead , wang's film is populated by a group of refreshingly off-beat characters living in the ultimate cultural melting pot : new york city . \\nthe laserman is a comic brew which celebrates ethnicity , eccentricity , and electricity . \\nthe film tells the bizarre story of arthur weiss ( marc hayashi ) , a chinese-american laser scientist whose life becomes incredibly hectic after he accidentally kills his lab assistant in an experiment . \\nhe loses his job but finds work with a mysterious company which secretly plans to use laser technology to commit dastardly deeds . \\narthur's professional life is cluttered with moral dilemmas . \\nhis personal life , on the other hand , is cluttered with colorful friends and quirky relatives . \\nin fact , arthur is by far the blandest character in the film , despite a charismatic performance by hayashi ( the san francisco-based actor whose films include chan is missing and the karate kid ii ) . \\nit's the auxiliary characters who give the laserman its unique spark . \\narthur's not-so-typical jewish mother , ruth , for example , is convinced that a chinese soul is trapped in her jewish body . \\nshe has dyed her red hair black , she takes herbal medicine daily , and she is perpetually cooking up strange delicacies , such as matzo balls in soy sauce--the ultimate fusion of jewish and chinese cuisine . \\nveteran stage actress joan copeland takes the part and runs with it , almost stealing the movie in the process . \\nshe plays ruth as a driven woman , determined to overcome her genetic heritage by immersing herself in chinese culture . \\narthur's girlfriend janet ( maryann urbano ) is a kooky free-spirit who would rather meditate than copulate ; her ultimate goal is orgasm through zen meditation . \\narthur's best friend , joey ( tony leung ) , is a small time thief who hustles everything from microwave ovens to machine guns . \\njoey is married to arthur's jewish sister , but he is also having an affair with a chinese immigrant who works in a whore house . \\narthur's 11-year-old son , jimmy , played by the amazingly adorable david chan , is--horror of horrors--bad at math ! \\nhe finds it impossible to meet his father's lofty expectations . \\nthe various people in arthur's life come together to form a rich tapestry of humanity . \\nlike wang's earlier film , a great wall ( about a san francisco family visiting relatives in china ) , the laserman revolves around cultural differences . \\nevery character in the film is , in some way or another , trying to find his identity--struggling to negotiate a balance between his native culture and the american way . \\nthe movie also offers a provocative look at technology . \\nwang appears in the movie as lieutenant lu , a detective who is fed up with machines , even though he relies on them to do his job . \\nthe film views technology with a wary eye , acknowledging its necessity while at the same time realizing its potential dangers . \\nwang raises the time-honored question of whether scientists should be held responsible for their inventions . \\nwas einstein responsible for the a-bomb ?

       " b' \" mandingo \" has traditionally been seen as one of two things : either a much-needed revisionist look at slavery in the south , or in the words of film critic leonard maltin , \" a trashy potboiler \" that \" appeals only to the s&m crowd . \" \\nactually , i think \" mandingo \" is a strange combination of the two , although it fails on both fronts . \\nit\\'s too trashy to be good drama , but too dramatic to be good trash . \\nthe story takes place on a dilapidated louisiana plantation run by crotchety old warren maxwell ( james mason ) and his son , hammond ( perry king ) . \\none day in new orleans , hammond comes across a slave trader selling a mandingo named mede ( heavyweight boxer ken norton ) . \\nalthough the movie never explains it , a mandingo is simply the name for africans who come from the region of the upper niger river valley . \\naccording to the movie , mandingos were the rolls royce of african slaves . \\nhammond pays top price for mede and has to fight off others in order to get him . \\nhammond then spends his time training mede to be a fighter in money brawls with other slaves . \\nmeanwhile , hammond has married his cousin , blanche ( susan george ) , because she wants to escape her family and he is under pressure from his father to produce a grandchild . \\nhammond , however , is happier spending nights with his \" bed wench , \" the derogatory name given to female slaves used by their masters for easy sex . \\nit is quickly apparent that hammond , despite his overt racism , is more in love with his bed wench , a sensitive slave girl named ellen ( brenda sykes ) , than he is with blanche . \\nhammond considers blanche tainted goods because he finds out on their wedding night that another man had \" pleasured \" her before he did . \\nof course , it\\'s fine that he\\'s slept with numerous slave girls , but the fact that his wife , a \" white lady , \" had been with another man out of wedlock destroys his capacity to care for her . \\nso blanche is usually left lonely and sex-starved while hammond is sleeping with ellen . \\nblanche gets back at hammond by seducing the studly mede and bearing his child . \\nhammond and his father cannot stand the idea that blanche has given birth to a half-black child ( although it\\'s okay that ellen was pregnant by hammond ) , so warren kills the child by letting it bleed to death after birth , and hammond poisons blanche . \\nhammond then finds mede , shoots him twice in the shoulder , and pushes him into a giant cauldron of boiling water . \\nyes , you read right : the film ends with hammond getting his revenge by boiling mede alive . \\njudging only by the plot , \" mandingo \" is pure sexploitation . \\nthe main purpose of the film seems to be getting as many blacks and whites into bed together as possible , with only the slightest commentary on what that would mean in 19th century southern society . \\nwhen \" mandingo \" was released in 1975 , it was still a bit of a shocker to see miscegenation on screen in such a graphic detail ; this way the movie could revise cinematic history while attracting large audiences of curious voyeurs . \\ndramatically , \" mandingo \" is weak and unfocused , and historically it\\'s mostly confused . \\nif one were to judge history by this film , it would be easy to walk away with the notion that the entire system of american slavery was based on sexuality , not economics . \\nnot once in the film do we see any of the slaves working , except for a few house servants . \\nthe men spend most of the time sitting around , while the sole purpose of a female slave seems to be free sex for the owner . \\nthere is historical basis in the notion that slave owners often slept with their female slaves , but \" mandingo\\'s \" overwhelming emphasis on this aspect of slavery gives the movie the unpleasant taste of a cheap sex flick ( although there\\'s plenty of violence -- fights , vicious beatings , shootings , and the aforementioned human boiling sequence -- thrown in for good measure ) . \\nsome tried to write off \" mandingo \" as a blaxploitation film , one of a number of quickly-made , low-budget films appealing to black sensibilities in the early seventies , but it\\'s not that easy . \\n \" mandingo \" was studio-financed by paramount pictures , and produced by dino de laurentiis , the grandiose italian producer behind such notorious productions as \" the bible \" ( 1966 ) , the remake of \" king kong \" ( 1976 ) , and the ill-fated \" dune \" ( 1984 ) . \\nthe director was richard fleischer , a veteran who was best known for several special effects-laden action movies including \" 20 , 000 leagues under the sea \" ( 1954 ) and \" fantastic voyage \" ( 1966 ) , as well as such superior suspense films as \" the narrow margin \" ( 1952 ) . \\nthe script , based on the supermarket best-seller by ken ostott ( and the subsequent play by jack kirkland ) , was penned by norman wexler , who had been nominated for an oscar two years earlier for his work on \" serpico . \" \\njames mason , perry king , and susan george were well-known and respected actors ( mason already had three oscar nominations under his belt ) , and ken norton appeared to have a promising film career . \\nso why is \" mandingo \" so bad ? \\na number of reasons , including the fact that all those experienced filmmakers behind and in front of the camera did a lousy job . \\nwexler\\'s script is pure poor hokum bordering on the offensive ; it combines stereotyped slave-talk ( \" yessuh , massuh \" ) , stereotyped southern white trash talk ( \" fer whut\\'re you gittin\\' outta bed ? \" ) , and stereotyped contemporary militant black talk ( \" if you see me hang , you gonna know you killed a black brother ! \" ) . \\nfleischer\\'s direction is clumsy , especially during the fight scenes , and all the actors give weak performances , especially susan george whose constant shrieking finally becomes laughable . \\nnevertheless , credit should be given where credit is due . \\ndespite its exploitative nature , \" mandingo \" was one of the first hollywood movies to take an alternative look at slavery . \\nuntil then , there had been a kind of underlying racism in all hollywood films dealing with slavery . \\neven classics such as \" gone with the wind \" ( 1939 ) can be seen as inherently racist by its glossing over the subject matter . \\n \" mandingo \" reassessed the south , and showed that it wasn\\'t all beautiful plantations , green fields , and pretty sunsets . \\nbut all this is constantly undermined by the film\\'s negligible point-of-view -- it claims to see things from the black perspective , but the entire narrative focus is on the soap opera tales of the white owners . \\nwith a little more maturity and different handling , \" mandingo \" might have been an effective , worthwhile film . \\nwhile it portrays many sensitive aspects of slavery , it never deals with them . \\nthe issues the movie brings up are worthwhile , but wexler\\'s script refuses to move them beyond a surface level of trashily vicarious viewing . \\nthere is a great deal of potential in honestly exploring the nature of a sexual relationship between slave and owner , but \" mandingo \" never does it . \\nsteven spielberg touched on that same topic in \" schindler\\'s list \" ( 1993 ) , by looking at a nazi officer writhing in inner turmoil because of his feelings for a jewish maid . \\nthe difference between that film and \" mandingo \" is that spielberg dealt with the situation in a fair , unexploitive manner that focused on the inherent human dilemma . \\n \" mandingo \" is satisfied to simply show some skin , and because of that , its \" trashy potboiler \" nature overshadows any potential social good it might have accomplished . \\n',\n",
       " b'known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \\nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film\\'s two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \\nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today\\'s films as it is here . \\nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend\\'s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \\nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \\nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \\nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he\\'d rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \\njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \\nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \\nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \\nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \\nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \\nyou honestly don\\'t need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \\nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \\nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \\nyou\\'d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i\\'ve seen on film in the 1990\\'s . \\nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \\nplaying sex symbols throughout the \\'80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \\njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988\\'s well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989\\'s \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \\nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \\nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \\nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \\nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \\nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \\non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel\\'s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \\nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \\n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you\\'d expect , and wouldn\\'t have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \\nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \\nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian\\'s best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie\\'s overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \\n',\n",

       " b'jackie brown entered theaters with little fanfare and a lot of expectation . \\neven though advance publicity on this one was fairly limited , the audiences waited for the showings with heightened anticipation . \\nthis is , after all , the first movie quentin tarantino has directed since the highly touted pulp fiction . \\nto say he has been inactive in between would be to tell a falsehood , since he has been involved in such projects as destiny turns on the radio , desperado , four rooms , and from dusk \\'til dawn . \\nhe was also called in at the last minute to help punch up the screenplay for crimson tide . \\n ( i\\'m willing to wager the debate over which silver surfer is the only true silver surfer was penned by him . ) \\ntarantino contributed on and off screen to these films , but never took the director\\'s helm . \\nnearly four years since gaining notoriety on the hollywood scene and making john travolta a star once more , tarantino returns with a film he can call his own . \\nthe film opens up with an homage to the graduate , with jackie brown ( pam grier ) on one of those airport people movers as the credits are displayed in front of her . \\njackie is a flight attendant for air cabo , which flies back and fourth between los angeles and cabo san lucas . \\nthis makes jackie a convenient cash courier for gun dealer ordell robbi ( samuel l . jackson ) who is currently keeping his money stashed in mexico . \\nhowever , while bringing fifty thousand dollars back into the u . s . for ordell , jackie is apprehended by fbi agent mark dargus ( michael bowen ) and atf agent ray nicolet ( michael keaton ) , who catch her not only with the money , but with a bonus of a couple of ounces of illicit drugs . \\njackie didn\\'t know they were in the package with the cash , but that\\'s of no consequence to the authorities , who threaten jackie with a couple of years hard time if convicted . \\nof course , dargus and nicolet are just using the sentence to get jackie to turn over the big fish , ordell . \\nordell uses honest bail bondsman max cherry ( robert forster ) to get jackie out of jail , but while max is immediately attracted to her , jackie is more concerned about her immediate safety , since ordell killed the last one of his operatives who got picked up by the police . \\nsure enough , ordell shows up at jackie\\'s apartment that evening and tries to silence jackie for good , but she \" borrows \" max\\'s pistol and manages to turn the tables on ordell . \\ninstead of closing the irony circle and relocating a bullet from the pistol\\'s chamber to ordell\\'s head , jackie proposes a deal . \\nsince ordell wants to get his money out of mexico , jackie will get back up to her old tricks and be a courier for him once more , but this time for a more substantial fee : fifteen percent of ordell\\'s half million dollars . \\nwith a gun in his face , how can ordell not agree ? \\nby itself , this premise might have been interesting enough to carry the film . \\nhowever , we are also introduced to a number of double crosses which make us pay attention and think . \\njackie claims to be bringing the money in for ordell , but she\\'s also making a deal with the feds as well as with max . \\nthe film throws us off every once in a while by leading us to believe the deal we thought was authentic is actually a sham , but it is in no way done to the extent that we feel jerked around . \\ninstead , it\\'s actually a nice departure from the predictability which is prevalent in so many of today\\'s movies . \\nat least this film has a little imagination . \\nmost of the performances in jackie brown are above par . \\npam grier , of whom i had never taken notice before , plays jackie with a mix of confidence and vulnerability which makes her character believable . \\nsamuel l . jackson has a kind of mesmerizing quality about him as he handles himself in situations where you know he is in total control . \\nrobert forster is thoroughly likable because he comes across as such an honest guy , trying to do his best . . \\nnever mind that he belongs to a profession where sneaking into a guy\\'s apartment to zap him with a stun gun is simply a matter of course . \\nhe\\'s just so down-to-earth , the nature of his job really doesn\\'t occur to us , even when we\\'re shown him bringing a handcuffed woman to prison , or when we see the tools of his trade . \\nin supporting roles are robert de niro as louis gara , a recently paroled friend of ordell\\'s , and bridget fonda as melanie , one of the girls ordell keeps around town . \\nunfortunately , de niro is basically wasted as his lines are few and far between , and then they are mostly clipped sentences . \\nin this film , he\\'s not really de niro , but stereotypical de niro , uttering things like , \" little bit , \" and \" pretty much . \" \\nfonda , on the other hand , plays the slightly spaced-out melanie with satisfactory relish and cuteness , such that even when she is annoying louis , we are taking her side . \\nas is characteristic of any film in which tarantino has had a hand , the dialog is quick and snappy . \\nit grabs our attention and is actually interesting , and in many respects , this makes jackie brown a film which needs few visuals ; the lines are a form of art in and amongst themselves . \\ndon\\'t count tarantino out when it comes to using the camera , however . \\nthere\\'s a scene where max is unwittingly watching a dry run of a money exchange , and he\\'s not really sure what\\'s happening , but by composing the scene just so , his realization of what\\'s going on is felt simultaneously by the audience . \\nwe look at the screen and think , \" gee , that\\'s clever , \" and then think the same thing about how the film induced us into that wonderful feeling of catching on . \\nalthough tarantino isn\\'t afraid to drag out a shot for dramatic effect , it unfortunately works to varying degrees in this film . \\nthere are shots where a character is simply driving , and we watch this person and somehow get an idea of what is going on in his or her head . \\nthis is a tribute to both direction and acting . \\nhowever , there is at least one other scene where we follow jackie through a mall , and she is looking for something ; desperately looking for something . \\nwe get the idea of the frantic nature of her search , but we follow her for so long that we end up not really caring about what she\\'s looking for , but instead hoping she\\'ll just stop . \\noverall , viewing jackie brown is time spent well . \\nsome flap has already been made about the language used in the film , but it\\'s really not much worse than many of the other movies out there today . \\nin fact , one might even be able to say that the way in which these \" offensive \" words are employed almost cause them to parody themselves and therefore transcend their own offensiveness . \\ngo see the film and see what i mean . \\n',\n",

\\nas in the original film , \" toy story 2 \" contains first-rate animation , and pixar studios has done a remarkable job improving on the impressive work they did there . \\nreportedly , the film was originally slated for a direct-to-video release , but after seeing the improvements that had been made , disney rightly decided to release it into theaters . \\nthe film is well worth seeing on the big screen . \\nthe colors are bright , the textures sharp , and even the human characters look more \" human . \" \\nthe animation is consistently seamless , with the action fast and furious and the facial expressions believable . \\nthere are so many impressive sequences that i\\'d find it impossible to list them here , but i was particularly wowed by a scene where buzz and his cohorts must get across a busy intersection to get to al\\' s toy barn , the store owned by woody\\'s captor . \\npixar\\'s rendition of the family dog is also nicely done , with fur so realistic you almost feel you could reach out and touch it . \\nthe voice work is also perfectly complementary , and as with the first movie , does much to help further character development . \\ntom hanks and tim allen again disappear into their roles as woody and buzz , making you forget who is doing the voice . \\nit was woody and buzz up there , not tom and tim . \\nall the cast members from the original reprise their roles , and each is excellent . \\nseveral new voices have been added , with joan cusack , kelsey grammer , and wayne knight doing fine work . \\n \" toy story 2 \" is strong in characterization , and is able to expand on what we saw in the first movie . \\nwoody faces difficult choices , while buzz is confronted with a new buzz who hasn\\'t yet realized his status as a toy , forcing him to see what he used to be like . \\nthe new characters are also developed quite well , especially jesse , who narrates a sarah mclachlan-aided flashback illustrating how she was loved , then forgotten by her owner . \\nit may be computer-animated , and it may have sappy music , but it\\'s downright touching . \\nthe script , despite having a story and screenplay each credited to four different writers , is endlessly clever and inventive , especially considering that it\\'s a sequel . \\nthe reason \" toy story 2 \" works where other movie sequels fail is that it refuses to just capitalize on the original\\'s success by re-doing the same story and using the same characters . \\nnot this one . \\nwe get character change , new characters , and new issues brought up . \\n \" toy story 2 \" is also remarkable for the way in which it keeps reinventing itself . \\nthere is always another clever idea waiting just around the corner here . \\nthe humor is sharp and witty , with something to amuse both kids and adults . \\nthere are funny asides to films such as \" star wars \" and \" jurassic park , \" among others , new takes on classic toys like barbie and rock \\'em sock \\'em robots , and appearances from other pixar efforts \" a bug\\'s life \" and the 1997 short \" geri \\'s game . \" \\n ( geri himself makes an appearance as a toy repairman who fixes woody\\'s broken arm . ) \\nthe action is fast and furious , and the chases ( in the street , in a toy store , in an elevator , on a baggage carousel , and in an airplane ) keep getting bigger and better . \\n \" toy story 2 \" never grows stagnant , because there is always something new to hold your interest . \\nthe more you pay attention to it , the more rewarding it is . \\nit\\'s rare to see a film like \" toy story 2 \" come along , because it\\'s the kind of film that\\'s almost impossible to dislike . \\nit\\'s created purely to entertain , and though i enjoy a thought-provoking drama as much as the next person , it\\'s nice to see that films are still trying to do exactly what movies first tried to do : send us out with a smile . \\nit\\'s a fair bet that the whole family will have smiles on their collective faces after seeing \" toy story 2 . \" it\\'s the rare sequel that manages to expand on , and live up to , the original . \\n',\n",
       " b\"the first thing you notice about this movie is that it's cold . \\nplaced in minnesota and north dakota during the winter , many of the scenes take place outside with long scenes of snow-covered ground against a background of white . \\njust what we need as bloomington struggles out of the endless long cold night . \\nas with most coen brothers films , this features outlandish characters in nefarious schemes , each of which works out in the oddest way possible . \\na car salesman hires a couple of hoods to kidnap his wife so that he can collect the ransom from her father . \\nalong the way everything that can possibly go wrong does . \\nin brief scenes of vicious violence , people get shot through the head , in the back , face , chest and various other areas of the anatomy . \\nthere is also one of the most unpleasant body disposal scenes yet seen on the screen . \\nremarkably enough , most of the movie is played for laughs . \\neven more remarkably , it works . \\nthe only likable person in the film is the very pregnant sheriff ( frances mcdormand ) who hunts down the killers while eating at every possible opportunity . \\nwith every good film the audience gains new knowledge . \\nhere you learn _two_ things . \\neveryone in minnesota speaks in an annoying whining accent that would drive you crazy . \\nand don't do violent illegal business with low-life amoral degenerate scum-sucking losers . \\noh yeah , if you get shot in the face , using a brightly decorated napkin to stop the bleeding just makes you look goofy . \\n\",\n",
       " b'i have to say it . \\ntim burton\\'s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . \\nok , that\\'s off my chest . \\nno more monkey puns , i promise . \\nseriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin\\' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . \\ni know , i know , i promised . \\nand for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton\\'s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . \\nmark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . \\nhe crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . \\ndespite being darker than the original , burton\\'s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . \\nsome of the movie\\'s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . \\nthen there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . \\nthe seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : \" one thing you don\\'t want in your house is a human teen-ager , \" he says . \\nyou don\\'t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . \\ntouches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton\\'s brand . \\nlines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian\\'s foot to try righting himself are : \" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . \" \\nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \\nanother of burton\\'s in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth\\'s gen . thade . \\nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \\nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \\nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : \" damn them , damn them all to hell , \" he says before expiring . \\nthat is the famous line heston\\'s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet\\'s terrible secret . \\nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \\nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \\nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \\nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \\nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \\nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \\nit is a masterful turn . \\nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \\nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \\nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \\na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \\nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , \" can\\'t we all just get along , \" echoing the words of rodney king . \\nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton\\'s technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \\nburton\\'s musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \\nthe movie\\'s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \\nhe comes close , but falls short . \\notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \\nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \\n',\n",
       " b'synopsis : al simmons , top-notch assasin with a guilty conscience , dies in a fiery explosion and goes to hell . \\nmaking a pact with malebolgia , a chief demon there , simmons returns to earth 5 years later reborn as spawn , a general in hell\\'s army donning a necroplasmic costume replete with knives , chains , and a morphing cape . \\nsullen , wise cogliostro and flatulating , wisecracking violator vy for spawn\\'s attention . \\ncomments : when todd mcfarlane left marvel comics ( where he had made a name for himself as a first-rate comic book penciller on the \" spider-man \" titles ) to join the newly-formed , creator-owned image comics , a new comic book legend was born : spawn . \\nmcfarlane\\'s \" spawn \" immediately became a commercial and critical success and a defining comic book series of the 1990s . \\nmcfarlane created a hero who was not only original but visually intricate , allowing mcfarlane to utilize his knack for artistic detail to the max . \\nthe early \" spawn \" issues brilliantly capture mcfarlane\\'s genius at illustration and show his early attempts at writing . \\nwith the popularity of \" spawn \" and the success of the current warner bros . \\'s batman film franchise , a movie version of some sort seemed inevitable for spawn . \\nin the summer of 1997 , hence , new line cinema released spawn , a live-action film based on the groundbreaking series . \\nthis topheavy exercise in violence and special effects unfortunately topples quickly and leaves fans of the comic book , like me , numbed by how much spawn misses the mark . \\nwhat happened ? \\nwhy is spawn so bad ? \\ntodd mcfarlane himself executive produced this disappointing misfire and even appears in a cameo . \\ni don\\'t think , however , that his presence necessarily hurt ( or helped ) the film . \\ni place the blame , in part , on the recent hollywood trend , fueled by public demand apparently , for special effects blow-out movies utilizing the latest computer technology . \\nthese films focus upon the effects at the expense of everything else : character , plot , dialogue , etc . spawn , reflecting this trend , shows the audience one gratuitous scene after another populated with morphing characters and filled with unnecessary pyrotechnics . \\nhardly a minute goes by in this film without fires , explosions , knives and chains appearing out of nowhere , glowing eyes , or constantly transforming demons . \\na lot of it is visually interesting and technically solid , don\\'t get me wrong , but , because the script and cast aren\\'t engaging , spawn ultimately comes across like overwrought wallpaper ( the surface may capture the eye , but nothing exists underneath ) . \\nspawn\\'s translation of the comic book suffers the most at the storyline level . \\nmcfarlane\\'s spawn was a tortured hero . \\na mercenary by trade , al simmons was nonetheless a warm man in love with the beautiful wanda . \\nhaving died and journeyed to hell , he made a pact to return to earth to be with wanda . \\nsimmons , however , discovers that his memories are fragmented , his body a creepy mess , and his wife married . \\ndespite his sometimes violent nature , readers couldn\\'t help but feel sympathetic toward his plight as the spawn of the underworld . \\nspawn attempts to show all of this but does not spend nearly the time it should to do so . \\nwhen the characters are developed , they seem absurd rather than touching . \\nthe cartoonish dialogue and implausible subplot ( a general possesses the antidote to a supervirus called heat-16 which he wishes to unleash to enslave the world ) do not help matters . \\nspawn , in an apparent attempt to duplicate the success of batman , also unwisely spends too much time on a villain , the violator ( batman favored the joker over batman ) . \\njohn leguizamo , like jack nicholson in batman , receives top billing in the cast as the violator ; michael jai white ( al simmons / spawn ) is second . \\ni ordinarily find leguizamo an intensely annoying presence in films which seems to make him a perfect candidate for the violator . \\nthe film , however , spends so much time on the violator\\'s offensive antics that they grate on the nerves . \\napparently meant to be the comic relief in the film ( as nicholson was in batman ) , especially when contrasted with the sullen spawn , the violator\\'s lines are oftentimes grotesque and unfunny , leaving the audience wishing he would leave . \\nleguizamo does a satisfactory job in the role , but he is seen far too often in the film . \\nmichael jai white , a relative newcomer to theatrical releases , seems to be an appealing actor , and he handles his role adequately , but we see little of him without various masks on . \\nmore time needed to be spent on white\\'s character before he became spawn for the movie to pull at the heartstrings . \\na special note should be made about martin sheen as the over-the-top , obnoxious , evil general wynn . \\neasily the hammiest performance in the movie , it\\'s hard to imagine how sheen mucked up his role so much ; after all , he played a vietnam assasin brilliantly in the great apocalypse now . \\nsheen\\'s excessive demeanor do not help the audience accept him as a mastermind villain and comes as a surprise considering his extensive career in film . \\nmany other elements conspire with the disappointing script and abundant special effects to drag spawn down . \\nmtv-style , jerky , in-your-face editing is one of them . \\nflames , for example , roll across the screen sometimes to announce a shift in setting . \\ncogliostro , unlikely wannabe guide for spawn , serves as a poor narrator for the film . \\nhe goofily tells the audience , at one point , that \" how much of [spawn\\'s] humanity is left remains to be seen , \" as if the audience really cares as one violent sequence leads to another . \\nthe music , finally , assaults the audience as much as the manic violence and offensive dialogue . \\nloud and obnoxious hard rock fused with drum loops dominate some scenes . \\nto be fair , however , marilyn manson\\'s \" long hard road out of hell \" effectively compliments spawn\\'s return to earth , while filter and the crystal method\\'s \" ( can\\'t you ) trip like i do \" proves a surprisingly fitting theme song . \\nfor as good a comic book as it is , \" spawn \" did not spawn a good movie . \\nspawn , instead , suffers from too much pomp and circumstance , and too little plot and character development . \\nit receives two stars for its technically well-done special effects . \\nmany other films , though , have equal , if not superior , special effects and are much better . \\nrated pg-13 , spawn seems more violent than many r-rated movies and probably wouldn\\'t be appropriate for the very young . \\n',\n",
       " b'i know there were times during this movie that i laughed pretty hard . \\nthe problem is , i can\\'t remember them as i write this review . \\nthat\\'s not a good sign . \\nin booty call , jamie foxx is bunz , a character whom i can\\'t really describe , because i don\\'t know that much about him . \\ni only know that he likes to shoot dice on the sidewalk , and that he doesn\\'t like relationships , just \" booty calls \" at three in the morning ( no questions , no commitment ) . \\nbunz has a best friend named rushon ( tommy davidson ) , who seems to be bunz\\'s direct opposite : on the straight and narrow , and currently in a long-term commitment ( a whole seven weeks , wow ! ) . \\nrushon wants to finally sleep with his girlfriend , nikki ( tamala jones ) , but for a reason which is not totally explained , it\\'s going to happen after a double date with bunz and nikki\\'s friend lysterine ( vivica a . fox ) , who have never met . \\nto make a long story short , the two couples pair off and spend the rest of the evening having their attempts to do the deed spoiled by nikki\\'s obsession with safe sex . \\nfirst she wants condoms , so bunz and rushon go out and get them . \\noh , no , they have to be latex , not lambskin . \\nback to the store . \\nnow they\\'ve got to get dental dams , or there\\'ll be no foreplay . \\nwhy are both couples stopped each time nikki makes a demand ? \\nnikki phones lysterine , who lives across the hall , and tells her she\\'d better be making these demands , too . \\ntalk about coitus interruptus . \\nbooty call is a film that does not know whether it wants to be a regular comedy or one of those over-the-top comedies . \\nthe difference between the two is that in the latter , things constantly happen which are so far removed from reality . \\nin this category , for example , you have ace ventura : private eye on the mild side , and airplane ! \\nat the extreme . \\nthere are times during booty call where the film steps out of its shell and tries for this status , but then too often quickly retreats to the safety of convention . \\nit is disappointing , and even worse , distracting . \\nthere are also instances where the screenplay by takashi bufford and bootsie parker ( are those real names ? ) \\ndoes not live up to its potential , as jokes are left unexploited or even ruined by bad writing . \\nfor instance , there is a scene where our main characters are in a chinese restaurant . \\nbunz goes up to an asian gangster and speaks to him in fluent cantonese , much to everyone\\'s surprise . \\nhowever , when asked how he learned the language , he goes into this explanation of how he started picking up words from late-night kung-fu films , and soon gained mastery . \\nthis negated the ludicrousness of the entire scene . \\nif , on the other hand , when asked how he learned to speak chinese , bunz simply replied with , \" kung-fu movies , \" and then moved on , the joke would have been much more effective . \\nthis is because it would have been totally unbelievable , but funny because we know it is unbelievable . \\nby explaining the point and trying to make the ridiculous plausible , the film is not giving its viewers enough credit . \\nthe inconsistency and uncertain believability unfortunately also raise other questions . \\nwhy are two such disparate people like bunz and rushon best friends ? \\nwhy do rushon and nikki fix up bunz and lysterine ? \\nif nikki is so obsessed with safe sex , why doesn\\'t she have some condoms at her own apartment ? \\nthese questions are not answered by the screenplay , but are overlooked for the sole reason of moving the plot forward . \\na very noticeable quality of booty call is the prevalence of unnecessary foul language . \\nsome movies use a lot of swear words , but use them under very justifiable circumstances , as when they are employed consistent with a character\\'s pattern of speech . \\nother films , such as the recent jackie brown , use them in ways that almost parody themselves . \\nbooty call just sticks them in to get laughs , and it doesn\\'t work . \\nthey stick out like sore thumbs because there is almost no reason to use them . \\nhalf of the scenes seem to occur for no reason . \\nthe chinese restaurant , a holdup at a convenience store , and a trip to the hospital seem to have nothing to do with the story , and are in there for filler . \\nthis is surprising , considering that the film is less than eighty minutes long . \\nit\\'s too bad that the core of the film isn\\'t much better , since it is comprised of sometimes funny , but forgettable dialog . \\ni refer you to the first paragraph of this review . \\n',\n",

those men were talented artists , and their films reflect their genius . ? \\nthey are likely to be remembered for . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , quite a while . ? \\ni like this film , too . ? \\nyes , it's a disaster-slash-action movie . ? \\ntrue , its budget is a lot more money than i'll ever see in my lifetime . ? \\nand there's not a doubt in my mind that the only reason it was conceived was to make a lot of money . ? \\nin fact , i bet the producers of armageddon would have worked towards a lousy film , had they thought it would've been more profitable . \\ni certainly don't care what their intentions were , because michael bay ( the rock ) is such a skilled director that i doubt he'd ever make a film that is difficult to sit through . \\nof course , skillful direction doesn't complete the package , but the rest of armageddon manages to keep everything together . \\nthe story is well-thought out ( and perfectly paced to provide for an abundance of action sequences that never feel out of place ) , the acting is terrific , the script is sharp , and -- get this -- there are characters . \\nyes , you read that right . \\narmageddon actually has characters you can care about ! \\nif you don't like this film , then you have a problem with the genre itself : armageddon is as good as a film like this can be . \\nif you've seen deep impact , then you know the basic framework for the story . \\nit turns out that an asteroid the size of texas is going to strike the earth eighteen days from the start of the film . \\nso , it's up to the u . s . government to stop it . \\n ( why the u . s . is always exclusively saddled with these problems is never fully investigated . ) \\ntheir plan -- to send a group of experienced oil drillers up to the asteroid , drill down several hundred feet , and detonate a nuclear warhead within . \\nthe head driller is harry stamper ( bruce willis ) . \\nhis group of men is a colorful bunch , including a . j . \\n ( ben affleck ) , chick ( will patton ) , and rockhound ( steve buscemi ) . \\nthere's also an interesting triangle formed between a . j . , harry , and grace ( liv tyler ) , who is harry's daughter . \\na . j . \\nand grace are , of course , romantically intertwined , and dad isn't too happy with the situation . \\nit's absurd to wish for a complicated story in an event movie or a special effects movie or whatever it is you'd like to call armageddon . \\nit's not about story -- it's about viscera and action , and thrills-a-minute , and all that stuff . \\nit's incidental , really , that the story is cohesive and even remotely believable , because most people will be too wrapped up in the explosions to give two seconds' thought to what actually happens . \\nbut bay is the one to congratulate in this case , for he has made a film so entertaining and so visually sharp that i doubt any director could have done it better . \\ni think most of the budget went to cameras alone , because bay films every action sequence from about thirty or forty different angles . \\ntake the spectacular opening scene , for instance , in which a meteor shower obliterates new york . \\na meteor flies out of the sky and crashes into a building , which sends fireballs erupting into the air and cars spinning like tops upon other cars . \\nthe action itself might take five seconds in real life , but bay edits so quickly that we get the same scene in six different ways . \\ni like his quick-edit style , because it's abrasive and exhausting to watch . \\nit's also very loud , and obnoxiously noisy at times . \\nbut it's fun to be obnoxious sometimes . \\nthe special effects in this film put every other 1998 blockbuster to shame . \\ndeep impact , visually , has absolutely nothing on armageddon , and to offer a comparison between the quality of this film and godzilla is simply laughable . \\nspecial effects are very important in a film like this : if they're not good , then the image is not convincing , and the film doesn't work . \\neverything here looks bright and explosive -- from the little meteors bursting through skyscrapers , all the way to the shots of the earth through the jutting rocks on the ominously approaching asteroid . \\nthe effects that don't look totally real are still a pleasure to behold , and i credit everyone involved for creating the first blockbuster so nice-looking that it actually qualifies as art . \\nof course , all of this would add up to little more than an above-average light show , if i didn't get the feeling that bay cares as much about his characters as he does about his action . \\nthe film is two and a half hours long , and not all of that is spent submerged in numbing action . \\nmuch of the film is dedicated to developing the various characters' subplots . \\ni won't suggest that these are complex characters , but their problems are real , and the emotions aren't put forth in a sentimental and overbearing way . \\nin fact , there are three or four scenes here that had me pretty choked up , and that's a lot more than i can say about deep impact , which was banking on the feel-good parts of its story . \\nbruce willis is terrific , and i'm glad to see him bigger than life again ( recent turns in films like mercury rising have been very disappointing ) . \\ntyler and affleck are great together , and make a convincing couple -- all of the scenes between them work on a comfortable level . \\npatton , who is a magnificent actor , thankfully is not wasted here , and the minor subplot revolving around his ex-wife and son is very moving . \\nthe comic relief from buscemi and peter stormare ( who plays a crazy russian astronaut ) is nifty , and keeps the film lively and funny . \\ni wasn't challenged to think real hard while watching armageddon , and i don't mind too much . \\nbut the film doesn't insult my intelligence -- it's pitched perfectly to entertain , which is what all it really wants to do . \\nit's not mindless and escapist , but well-crafted cinema . \\nit might have been created for the wrong reasons , but men like michael bay have my respect for showing me that they are interested in making something good , in spite of the producers and the budget . \\ni'm not saying that films like this are risky moves . \\nwhat i am saying is that armageddon is a big , loud , expensive motion picture that reminds me that art often comes in the strangest of forms . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"there's an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last . \\ngeorge lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy . \\nreturn of the jedi , the final installment of the series , is easily the most innovative , action-packed , and entertaining of the three films . \\nthe dark , eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone . \\ninstead , for return of the jedi , we have good triumphing decisively over evil , a resolution to a love triangle , and walking teddy bears . \\neven darth vader doesn't seem very intimidating this time around . \\nwith the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid ) , vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman . \\nreturn of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back . \\nluke skywalker ( mark hamill ) , princess leia ( carrie fisher ) , lando calrissian , ( billy dee williams ) , chewbacca ( peter mayhew ) , c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to luke's home planet of tatooine . \\ntheir goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt . \\nit is at jabba's home , a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts , that most of the added special effects come into play . \\nfrom a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabba's sand barge , the effects are top notch . \\nas soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt , it's back to outer space , where the rebel alliance is about to face the empire's newest threat : a second , more powerful death star , that , if activated , could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor . \\nso , while the fleet prepares for the final battle , luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks . \\nthere , they are befriended by the ewoks , the teddy bear-like native race , and luke , fearing that his presence is endangering the group , turns himself over to vader . \\nreturn of the jedi has some interesting elements . \\nthe scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted . \\nfrom a technical point-of-view , the space battles are amazing , easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films . \\nnot only are there many , many more ships , but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved . \\non one level , return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects . \\nin the special edition , even more ships are added , making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch . \\nthe acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films . \\nby now ( or then - 1983 ) , mark hamill , harrison ford , and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas . \\nthe chemistry amongst the trio is terrific . \\nas in empire , billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for . \\nnewcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy , cunning , and evil creature , although he's not as imposing as vader was in star wars . \\nalthough it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen , return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment . \\nwith the spectacular , new special effects , the adorable ewoks , the sinister jabba the hutt , the evil emperor , the same old millenium falcon , darth vader's incredible betrayal , the destruction of the new death star , and the always lovable yoda , return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang . \\ncongratulations to george lucas , whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come . \\n , \\n\",\n",
       " b'when you go to the movies as much as i do , you unfortunately end up seeing certain movie trailers one too many times . \\nsuch was the case with frequency . \\nevery time i went to a screening , there was the frequency preview . \\nit looked awful . \\nit looked cheesy , sappy and ridiculous . \\nit looked like a flop . \\nwell , whoever put that trailer together should be fired , because in terms of pure entertainment , frequency is one of the best of the year thus far . \\nfrequency boasts a compelling story line . \\nan occurrence of freakish solar activity allows police detective john sullivan ( james caviezel ) to speak to his fireman father frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) through a ham radio , despite the fact that frank has been dead for 30 years . \\njohn is able to give his father information that prevents his death in a warehouse fire , but by doing so causes other changes . \\nsomehow , a serial killer\\'s reign of terror , which in the original timeline had been stopped at three murders , extends to ten victims . . . \\nincluding john\\'s mother . \\nthis is director gregory hoblit\\'s third film ( the other two being primal fear and fallen ) . \\nwith all three , he\\'s managed to attach himself to great scripts ( this one by toby emmerich , whose only previous movie experience was as a music supervisor on numerous new line films ) and add equally great direction . \\nalso , he apparently likes to have his films wrap up with a kick-ass ending . \\nfrequency is no exception , the ending is unpredictable and incredibly satisfying . \\nhoblit is three for three , and i hope he can keep it up . \\nnow everyone can argue logic this and logic that all you want with the sci-fi elements of frequency . \\nbut the fact of the matter is that time travel has never been achieved . \\nwho\\'s to say how something works and how it doesn\\'t when it\\'s never happened ? \\nis it because we\\'ve become accustomed to time travel \" laws \" from other places like \" star trek \" and the back to the future trilogy and \" quantum leap \" ? \\nyes , if you sit down and think about it , certain plot elements in this film probably won\\'t make any sense . \\nmost films are like that . \\ndon\\'t let that dissuade you from seeing this fantastically entertaining film however . \\nwhen frequency was over , it made me wish i had seen it with my father so i could have given him a hug ( okay okay , shut up ) . \\nwhen you break it down past all its sci-fi elements and serial killer antics , frequency is simply a movie about a father and his son and the bond that they share . \\nit\\'s touching , it\\'s sincere , and it\\'s what ultimately makes this movie work . \\n[pg-13] \\n',\n",

       " b'the obvious reason for producing a sequel to an immensely popular movie is to acquire continued profits . \\nthe rationale is sound , but in many cases of this and recent years , the sequel is a shoddy product that\\'s exposed for the cash-milking vehicle it really is . \\nlast year\\'s speed 2 and scream 2 , as well as this year\\'s species ii have all been products that have been decisively less than satisfactory . \\nin some cases , a sequel can even discredit its predecessor , as with the latest neo-slasher flick , i still know what you did last summer . \\nwhatever uniqueness the original might\\'ve had now seems trite and overplayed when paired with this abominable thriller . \\njulie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) and ray bronson ( freddie prinze jr . ) are back from the original to star in i still know , reprising their roles in typical fashion . \\njulie and ray experience a rather predictable falling-out at the beginning of the movie , leaving the door wide open for newcomer will benson ( matthew settle ) . \\nwill and julie hit it off , and along with friends karla ( brandy norwood ) and tyrell ( mekhi phifer ) , the foursome heads off to a radio station-giveaway vacation in the tropics . \\nunfortunately , things aren\\'t so peachy once they arrive , and with a regularity you could set your watch by , the infamous fisherman ( muse watson ) is back with his hook . \\nit\\'s another bloody showdown , complete with cliffhanger ending . \\nthere\\'s not much that\\'s original about i still know , and with the market saturated by gen-x thrillers like this one , it\\'s unlikely that i still know will get any recognition other than that of a bad sequel . \\nfor die-hard fans of the genre , this will be required viewing material , but the bottom line is that the material here is just recycled from the original i know what you did last summer . \\nthe aura of thrillerism surrounding the plot isn\\'t heightened by skillful scripting or camera work , but rather a tense , string-based score and manipulative editing . \\nthe man with the hook ends up becoming very belittled this time around when the script gives him too many lines of dialogue -- he goes from being a scary figure to a nutcase in a few short and painful moments . \\nmuch of the mystery is dropped for the sake of getting the point . \\nthe whole reason the plot exists - julie and karla must guess the capital of brazil in order to win the trip from the radio station - is a dead giveaway , lessening suspense and creating a hurry-up-and-wait timing problem . \\nand , whereas the killer\\'s identity might\\'ve been a question in the first movie , it\\'s almost a given here , which changes the dynamic of the movie drastically . \\nthree or four teens run automatically from a man in a rain slicker they nonchalantly refer to as \" the killer . \" \\nthey\\'re almost used to it , and the performances show it - not hewitt , nor prinze , nor brandy , nor phifer give a decent show . \\nand so , in the end , it\\'s left wide open for a third movie and - most likely - a brand new supporting cast . \\ngod help us . \\n',\n",

a gothic city rather than a modern one . \\nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \\nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\\'s geno\\'s steaks . \\nshadows and night scenes abound . \\nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \\nthis is the kind of setting where it\\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \\nfallen\\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \\nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \\nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \\nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \\nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \\nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \\njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \\nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \\neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \\nwashington\\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \\nit\\'s not that he\\'s bad per se , but he\\'s not very interesting . \\nthere\\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \\nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \\nwashington\\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \\nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \\nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \\nthat said , however , there\\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\\'s or sutherland\\'s work . \\nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \\nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \\nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \\nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \\nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \\nhowever , despite the negatives , i\\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \\nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \\nit\\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \\nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \\nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \\nand , whatever you do , don\\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \\n',\n",

       " b'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nlike its own opening shot , from out of the darkness boogie nights triumphantly explodes upon the film scene with stunning authority and clarity , persuasively heralding its helmer paul thomas anderson as a bonafide major talent . \\na sprawling epic set in the heart of the disco era and focused upon the ascension and decline of a troupe in the adult film industry , boogie nights is an astonishingly ambitious feature film which is completely effective both as an utterly entertaining joyride and as a strikingly impressive piece of filmmaking . \\nthe film follows a soft-spoken young man , eddie adams ( mark wahlberg ) from torrance , through his induction into the erotic picture business to stardom , and later , to a harrowingly precipitous drop . \\nas boogie nights opens , he\\'s toiling as a dishwasher in a trendy san fernando valley nightclub , and living at home under the thumb of a tyrannical mother who denigrates him at every opportunity . \\nrecruited by fatherly jack horner ( a rejuvenated burt reynolds ) , a successful porn filmmaker , eddie abandons his old life in favour of a new one as dirk diggler , pornstar . \\nwholeheartedly embraced by jack\\'s troupe , including the maternal amber waves ( julianne moore ) , reed rothchild ( john c . reilly ) , buck swope ( don cheadle ) , rollergirl ( heather graham ) , dirk and his \" one special thing \" are quickly propelled to the top of his field , fulfilling his mantra of being a \" big bright shining star \" . \\nhis lack of discipline , however , incites a chain of circumstances which sees dirk and his friends unravel as a new decade is ushered in . \\nthe element of boogie nights which literally commands attention is the bravura direction by mr . anderson , whose fascination and prowess with the camera is obvious . \\nfrom the terrific tracking shot throughout a nightclub which opens the film and introduces the players through to the showy sequence in the camera follows a female partygoer diving into a pool , mr . anderson\\'s accomplished command of the camera is without question . \\nwhile novice directors often demonstrate an unfortunate lack of restraint in terms of flamboyant camerawork which ultimately proves to be aggravating , impertinent and self-congratulatory ( case in point : marc rocco\\'s unforgettable perpetual-motion helming of murder in the first ) , in boogie nights every zoom or pan by mr . anderson , be it slow and deliberate or energetically sharp , is purposeful and potent . \\nit\\'s a rarity and a delight to discover such a confidently assured work so early in a filmmaker\\'s career -- boogie nights is only his second feature film , following up his debut feature from earlier this year , hard eight -- and although it\\'s somewhat derivative ( his storytelling style is reminiscent of robert altman , while in terms of visuals he\\'s clearly influenced by martin scorsese ) , at least he\\'s borrowing from some of the best , and it\\'s entirely effective within the context of this film . \\nwhile boogie nights is astonishingly polished from a technical perspective , in terms of sheer entertainment value it\\'s also rollicking good fun , with a wickedly deadpan sense of humour . \\nthe film perfectly captures the essence of the disco period in terms of music , clothes , hairstyles , dance , idioms , and culture , aided immeasurably by impeccable production design by bob ziembicki and costume design by mark bridges , and boogie nights convincingly catapults the audience back to this recent , pre-aids-scare period in american history where uninhibited , free-wheeling lifestyles abounded . \\nwhile much of the film\\'s humour pertains to the characters\\' obliviousness of now-outdated aspects of their lives then prevalent in society -- a prime example is part-time salesman buck swope\\'s demo of a stereo system with an eight-track tape , and inviting a prospective customer to get \\'freaky deaky\\' with the music -- it\\'s elicited with an undercurrent not of ridicule , but of wistful reminiscence , and some the throwback elements in the film are strangely wondrous . \\na giant ensemble disco dance production number in a nightclub is funny , to be sure , but oddly magical , and the sequence which lovingly explores eddie/dirk\\'s bedroom , completely adorned with posters and elements of iconic 1970s figures ( farrah fawcett , cheryl tiegs , bruce lee ) is breathtaking . \\nably supported by a well-selected collection of period music ( all of which purportedly came straight from mr . anderson\\'s personal collection ) , there\\'s a clear affection for the era in boogie nights . \\nit\\'s the period aspect and the playfully comic nostaligism of boogie nights which has been played up in its marketing campaign in deference of the pornography element of the storyline ; the film\\'s promotional trailer markedly avoids any explicit reference to the adult film industry which unites its characters . \\nafter the debacle with 1996\\'s milos forman film , the people vs . \\nlarry flynt , another finely-crafted work which was knocked off the market prematurely due to controversy regarding its pornography-related storyline , the new line marketing team faced a unique challenge with boogie nights in terms of attempting to deemphasize the relatively risque erotic picture element of the story in order to increase salability to the general public . \\nhowever , while boogie nights delves into the world of the adult film industry of two decades ago , it\\'s hardly a lurid or seamy film -- given the subject matter , there\\'s very little nudity , and virtually none of it can be construed as gratuitous -- and boogie nights smartly depicts erotic filmmaking not as a hotbed of carnality , but simply as a business . \\nthe glimpses on the sets of jack horner\\'s shoots reveal that while the films he makes are intended to titillate , there\\'s a candid matter-of-factness in terms of sex ; his cast and crew are professionals who are merely doing a job , and it\\'s refreshing that the obvious cliches of depravity and sinful lechery often linked to dismissive portraits of adult filmmaking , such as coercion or debauchery , are avoided . \\nif anything , boogie nights is more interested in the process of adult filmmaking than the adult films themselves . \\njack horner\\'s dream is an honourable one -- he genuinely aspires to make a great film -- and to some degree boogie nights is reminiscent of ed wood ( albeit lacking a certain wistful innocence ) . \\nin both films , the world of quickie low-budget filmmaking is explored , and both jack horner and the version of ed wood by tim burton , scott alexander , and larry karaszewski share similar mindsets -- jack\\'s retort of \" there are shadows in light , baby \" to his cinematographer\\'s complaint about poor set lighting echoes back to ed wood\\'s \" it\\'s not about the little details , it\\'s about the big picture ! \" \\nrant when it is pointed out that his graveyard set for plan 9 from outer space appears patently false . \\nin boogie nights and ed wood , the aspirations of the respective filmmakers\\' prove to be bemusing , not in their intentions -- there\\'s nothing inherently silly in the goal of making an \\'artistic\\' erotic picture -- but in the degree that they miss the mark . \\nmuch like the humour lacing ed wood , the laughs involving jack horner are double-edged ; after viewing a hilarious excerpt from one of his latest films which hybridizes the james bond and porn genres , when jack breathes \" this is the best work i\\'ve ever done \" , it\\'s genuinely funny , but given his utter sincerity , also possesses a tinge of sadness . \\nmr . anderson is at this point clearly a greater talent as a director than a screenwriter . \\nwhile boogie nights shows great inventiveness in staging , there really isn\\'t any clever dialogue in the film , though a valid point certainly can be made that none of the film\\'s characters particularly lend themselves to thoughtful verbal exchanges ; when one considers that the film\\'s * protagonist * literally doesn\\'t say a single insightful thing throughout the entire 152 minute running time , it\\'s no wonder why the playfully inane \" how much can you bench ? \" \\nbanter between dirk and reed constitutes one of the film\\'s finest exchanges . \\nand while mr . anderson creates a rich collection of fascinating characters , it\\'s problematic that some of the the threads given to the film\\'s characters are simply stale material -- julianne moore\\'s child custody battle is fairly cliched stuff , better suited for a less risque and uninspired tv-movie version of her character\\'s story , and far less interesting than the thread dealing with her woefully hackneyed filmmaking ambitions . \\nstill , even if he doesn\\'t always know what to do with his characters , mr . anderson most definitely captures their essences , and his resolutely nonjudgemental affection for them is infectious -- misguided , even aimless , hopelessly naive , self-destructive , insufferable : i loved them just the same . \\nin any case , it\\'s hard to pick nits with a screenplay which contains one of the most audacious and inspired ( and ultimately best-executed ) scenes of the year : a scene where dirk diggler and reed rothchild are dragged along by their loose-cannon compadre to the home of drug baron rahad jackson ( a mesmerizing alfred molina in an unforgettable performance , even if it\\'s a small one ) in a suicidal drug deal scam , only to find that the millionaire is a crazed eccentric ( the part where he stops the deal to listen to the crescendo of night ranger\\'s \" sister christian \" on his stereo system is sheer brilliance ) flanked by an armed bodyguard . \\nif this scene already wasn\\'t tense enough with these elements , mr . anderson introduces a chinese boy that wanders through the scene , who for no discernable reason is tossing firecrackers around the room , pushing the scene to a new , surreal level of delightful giddiness . \\nthere are some other interesting touches in boogie nights . \\nmr . anderson recycles the use of long methodical chimes on the soundtrack from hard eight ; here , it accompanies the violent intercut sequences which depict the prostration of various characters to frightening effect . \\nsimilarly , a painful scene where crew member scotty j ( philip seymour hoffman ) breaks down in tears in the driver\\'s seat , sobbing \" i\\'m so stupid \" after being rebuffed by dirk after an awkward but heartfelt advance is strikingly played out exactly as a later scene with dirk in the driver\\'s seat after a particularly tumultuous and traumatic evening . \\nboogie nights is exceedingly well cast , and each of the actors rise to the occasion ; the ensemble cast is uniformly good . \\nwhile most of the acting accolades will no doubt go to mr . wahlberg ( fulfilling upon the sparks of promise he demonstrated in some of his earlier films ) and mr . reynolds ( terrific as the father figure and stable anchor of the film , ringing true in every respect ) , a handful of other performances which might otherwise be overlooked deem mention . \\nmr . reilly demonstrates here , as he did for brief glimpses in ulu grosbard\\'s georgia , a genuine aptitude for comedy -- many of his scenes in boogie nights are among the very funniest in the film . \\ni\\'m not sure how much of his performance as reed was scripted and how much was done on the spot , but he plays the quintessential second banana character to a tee . \\nmr . reilly is the best part of the big disco dance production number , and it\\'s wickedly funny to watch his reed join in with dirk after the fact in threatening the new stud on the block during a macho altercation . \\nworth the price of admission alone is the glimpse of him getting down in the recording studio while the dirk character is laying down a numbingly bad ( and dead-on period ; it sure sounds like bad early 1980s to me ) demo track \" you got the touch \" in a vain attempt at a musical career . \\nmr . reilly plays his vacant character with utter conviction which is convincing and effective . \\nms . graham , with her long dirty blonde hair , innocent demeanour , and huge hazel eyes , looks like a disney animated heroine come to life -- or in this case , a disney animated heroine who came to life , made a wrong turn , and ended up on the new line lot in a film focused on the late 70s / early 80s adult film industry . \\nconsequently , it\\'s a bit incongruous to see this cheery sweet-faced starlet whizzing about the set on her roller skates , but in a scene where she\\'s lounging in a limousine prowling the streets , garish red lipstick messily smeared on , giving the camera a hilariously pouty come-hither look , all one can do is gulp . \\nher role in the film sadly needs more fleshing out ( err -- in a figurative sense ) -- she\\'s essentially a glorified extra -- but she does score impressively in her key scene which is unnerving in its sheer primal ferocity . \\n ( if only mr . anderson had filmed the scene so that we could actually see the expression of rage and anguish on her face , though ! ) \\nand a cautionary tale for the strict and prudish : as a teen , ms . graham\\'s parents forbade her to take a part in the twisted cult classic heathers ; since then , her most notable roles have been as a junkie ( gus van sant\\'s drugstore cowboy ) and now a porn starlet . \\ndraw your own conclusions . \\nperhaps the most quietly touching performance in boogie nights is that of mr . cheadle , who lends dignity to his role as a character in search of his identity , and whose quest is comically manifested by a series of changes in his sense of fashion . \\nhis relationship with his cheerfully supportive new wife jessie st . vincent ( an interesting melora walters ) is wholly compelling has genuine sweetness , and although his general longing for acceptance from others is perceptible , it\\'s no more so than in the bank scene where his loan application to open a stereo store is rejected due to his background in the porn industry . \\nwhile the scenario is familiar , the wounded look in cheadle\\'s eyes makes the scene unforgettable . \\nluis guzman\\'s most famous work is possibly in brian de palma\\'s carlito\\'s way , and here he plays a variation on the same character : maurice t . rodriguez is a hapless but good-natured nightclub owner who\\'s a hanger-on to jack\\'s group , ingratiating himself into the clique and constantly hounding jack , with little disguise made of his desperation , for a part in one of his erotic pictures . \\njack\\'s eventual acquiescence to maurice\\'s request leads to one of boogie nights\\' biggest comic payoffs . \\nboogie nights is a stunning achievement due to the virtuoso direction by mr . anderson , who immediately asserts his presence in the film industry as a presence of note with this work . \\nstriking a fine balance between humour and drama , and exceptionally well-crafted , there\\'s no doubt that boogie nights is among the very best films of the year . \\n',\n",

       " b\"nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \\nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \\nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \\nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \\ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he's going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \\nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona's h . i . mcdonnough . \\ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \\nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there's one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it's that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \\nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage's performance . \\nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \\nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \\nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage's goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \\naudiences , too , should know what they're getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \\nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \\nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \\ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab's soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it's perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \\nwhat he doesn't deliver is a moment of suspense . \\na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock's notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \\nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air's creepiest set-up . \\nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \\ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \\nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \\nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \\nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \\nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \\nit doesn't bode well for cage's appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \\nthere's a word for people like you , nicolas . \\nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \\noffender . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"one of the most popular subplots in the entire science fiction genre is time travel . \\nthat concept , although many purists doubt its scientific credentials , spawned many interesting novels , comic books and films in the last century . \\nhowever , the big grand-daddy of time travels , h . g . wells' novel the time machine , wasn't written with the intention to speculate about that concept or its consequences . \\nthe author , h . g . wells merely used it as a convenient way to express his socialist views and condemn the great social gap between the rich , idle capitalist class and impoverished labour . \\nwhatever intentions wells had , the future generations of readers were less impressed by his political messages . \\ninstead they were fascinated by the idea that the strange new worlds could be explored without traveling trough space . \\nthe novel became one of great classics of science fiction genre and it natural for filmmakers to use it as inspiration . \\nfirst of them was george pal , who in 1960 directed film which would , through the years , become genre classic of its own . \\nthe plot revolves about george ( rod taylor ) , victorian scientist who discovered the way to travel through the fourth dimension - time . \\nat the eve of the new 20th century , george gathers his friends in order to present them his invention - machine that would enable him to travel through time . \\nthey are skeptical , but that doesn't prevent george from carrying out his plan and traveling into the future . \\nat first , he travels slowly , seeing london as it changes through the years and three world wars . \\nfinally , after witnessing world war three , he travels far into the future , hoping that he would cease to witness wars and senseless destructions . \\nwhen he finally reaches year 802 , 701 ad , at first glance , new world looks like utopia - humanity consists of young , beautiful , but idle eloi , people who are fed , clothed and taken care of by unseen machines . \\nbut , weena ( yvette mimieux ) , eloi woman , tells george about another side of the coin - in the night , her people is preyed upon by morlocs , humanoid creatures from the underworld . \\nthe time machine became the cinematic classic for the very same reason the novel became the classic in science fiction literature - the fantastic concept was a brilliant way for the authors to talk about burning issues and fears of their respective times . \\nfor h . g . wells it was frightening threat of class struggle ; for george pal and his screenwriter david duncan , who produced the film in the worst days of the cold war , it was the constant and more imminent threat of nuclear holocaust , underlined with the negative references to war throughout the movie . \\neven the modern audience , which would be tempted to discard the film as old-fashioned , could find some values in its universal messages , fit for each era . \\ncompared with the genre films of today , the time machine is even better , and could serve as a good example how to make intelligent , thought-provoking films . \\nof course , since this is hollywood product after all , the time machine delivers such concepts in the form of classic adventure , sometimes sacrificing plausibility for the sake of attractiveness . \\nfor example , it is hard to imagine that someone would be able to understand perfect english million years in future ; same is with morlocs degenerating into mutant monsters , while eloi remain undistinguished from the people of today . \\nsome of the final scenes , that turn victorian scientist into an action superhero , are also rather unconvincing . \\nbut , on the other hand , the film is very well directed , cleverly paced and the special effects , although definitely old-fashioned , are more than adequate for this kind of picture . \\nthe acting is good , with rod taylor in one of his most remembered roles , while in the same time alan young brings rather memorable performance as george's trusted friend filby . \\nyvette mimieux , who plays weena , on the other hand , would be remembered more by her looks than by the complexity of her role . \\nhowever , despite all those flaws , the time machine is a very good piece of cinema , something that connoisseurs of quality science-fiction films sorely miss these days . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"the happy bastard's quick movie review \\nthe concept of enjoying a stupid comedy is best realized as keeping it stupid , really . \\nshift gears even once and the audience can be thrown miserably out of control . \\nsadly , that is the case with kingpin , a film directed by the farrelly brothers , the duo that brought us there's something about mary and dumb and dumber . \\nsince the duo directed and didn't write the script , i can assume that's part of the problem . \\nthe story seems good enough : a pro bowler in the 1970's by the name of roy munson ( woody harrelson ) is sitting on top of the world . \\nhis popularity has gone through the roof and he's getting his career off the ground . \\nthen , however , he runs into ed mccracken ( bill murray ) , a rival bowler with hardly any real consideration for , well , anything . \\nthese two form an ill-timed relationship that involves risky betting , and , before roy sees it coming , ed's abandoned him and he's about to lose his hand in a bowling ball machine . \\nforward seventeen years later , where roy has become quite the loser , complete with mechanical hand , torn-up car , and , of course , the occasional knocking up of the ugly-ass landlord to avoid paying rent for a while . \\nhowever , he finds a glimmer of a hope upon a visit to a local bowling alley , where he runs into an amish kid named ishmael ( randy quaid ) , who has quite the bowling arm . \\nwith the kid's help , he figures he can be known again , particularly at the biggest bowling tournament rapidly approaching in reno , nevada . \\nof course , the amish kid needs some coaxing , particularly when you consider , well , he's amish . \\nthis leads to some of the best comic scenes in the film , such as roy's process of removing horseshoes or milking the cow . \\nfinally , the duo get on the road and , along the way , pick up an additional helper- a beautiful hustler ( played by the gorgeous vanessa angel ) . \\nthe main problem i had with kingpin wasn't the fact it wasn't funny . \\nin fact , it does have some rather hilarious scenes in it , such as the aformentioned above and roy's explanation of not having children ( something involving a cheese grater ? ) . \\nbut that's just it- scenes . \\nthere's a couple of really serious scenes that throw off the entire momentum of the movie , like the abuse angel takes from her hustler ex-boyfriend . \\ni mean , was this really necessary ? \\ncouldn't have this been handled just a bit wackier ? \\ni mean , this is a comedy , why throw ethics in ? \\nparticularly in a farrelly brothers vehicle , where hair gel can be easily mistaken ? \\nthat really ruined it , however , and that's too bad . \\nthe acting is top notch , especially from angel and murray , and the really funny scenes are worth noting . \\nstill , if you're going to think dumb , think dumb all the way through , ok ? \\nat least the farrelly brothers got back on track with mary or i'd still be a little bit irked . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"curdled is a deliciously dark and witty black comedy , but its humour won't appeal to everyone . \\nto be specific , let me give you an example . \\ndo you know in pulp fiction where jules and vincent go on brain detail after marvin and his head accidentally get separated ? \\nif you thought that was completely tasteless and unfunny , don't see curdled . \\non the other hand , if you found that sequence to be pretty funny , you have the sense of humour that curdled is aimed at . \\nour film's heroine , gabriela , played by angela jones , is a woman obssessively curious about murder and serial killers ; she even keeps a scrapbook of news articles . \\nluckily for her , miami is being plagued by a serial killer rampage - her scrapbook is getting pretty big . \\nthe killer's nickname in the press is the blue blood killer , because he preys on older rich socialite women , and he's played by william baldwin ( this is not a spoiler ) . \\none particularly striking m . o . \\non the blue blood killer is his propensity to decapitate his victims . \\ngabriela is watching television one day when she spots an advertisement for a firm whose line of work is perfectly attuned to her interests . \\nshe immediately quits her job , and signs on with pfcs , which stands for post-forensic cleaning service . \\nno points for guessing what they do . \\nher workmates are confused by gabriela's fascination with murder ; to them , it's just a day job . \\nthere's a hilarious locker room scene where they debate whether decapitated heads can talk , and what they would say . \\ngabriela's partner , elena , played by mel gorham , is particularly perturbed by gabriela's wide-eyed fascination , and becomes really upset when gabriela volunteers them to clean up the blue blood killer's latest scene - they're the messiest , you see . \\nunbeknownst to them , the last victim left something on the scene which would id the blue blood killer , so he's also heading over there . . \\nthe comparison to pulp fiction earlier on was not accidental - quentin tarantino executive-produced this film , which began life as a short film he saw at a film festival . \\napparently tarantino was so impressed that he helped braddock convert this into a feature-length film . \\nthere are other parallels - the star of curdled is angela jones ( the top billing goes to william baldwin , but really , jones is the central character ) , who's probably best known for her role as esmerelda villalobos , the death-obssessed taxi driver in pulp fiction . \\nthat role was written specifically for jones based upon her similar character in the aforementioned short film , curdled jr . \\njones is great in curdled - she's wonderfully funny and maintains an amusing wide-eyed naive curiousity about murder without compromising her character's innocence or likeability . \\nshe can express so much with one lift of her eyebrow . \\nit's a great performance . \\nreb braddock's direction is extremely sharp and clever , toeing the line between black humour and bad taste . \\nthe best scene in the film is an outrageously funny sequence involves jones and dancing - any more than that would be a spoiler . \\nthe opening credit sequence is also inventive and amusing . \\nof course , it's impossible to really take this stuff seriously , but then again you're not really supposed to - braddock knows the audience is in on the joke , and makes it a fun little romp as a result . \\nthe one drawback of curdled is that it was based on a short film , and it feels like it ; the material is just stretched too thin in order to fulfill a feature length running time , and some parts just seem to drag . \\nwhile its running time is already a short 94 minutes , it could really stand to lose twenty minutes or so to give it better pacing . \\ncurdled seems destined to be a nice cult film for miramax . \\nit'll be interesting to see if it will appeal to mainstream audiences as well . \\n\",\n",
       " b'even the best comic actor is at the mercy of his or her material , as this subpar submarine comedy proves . \\ndown periscope stars kelsey \" frasier \" grammer as an inept navy captain who is given command of his own ship as part of a corrupt officer\\'s ( james coburn ) plan to get him out of the navy . \\nlike any lame emsemble comedy , the officer assigns him to a group of misfits like the guy who wants to be kicked out , the fat guy who eats all the time , the beautiful woman who doesn\\'t belong there ( lauren holly ) , the second-in-command who does everything by the book ( rob schneider ) , the crazy old guy who freaks everyone out ( harry dean stanton ) and so on . \\nthen comes the transparent plotline . \\nfirst grammer has to fix up the delapidated korean war ship the navy has given him , and that comes courtesy a sad sight gag montage that includes a guy with a mop knocking schneider overboard . \\nafter the ship is fixed up come the early drills , where everyone seems completely inept , like the electrician who can\\'t connect wires so instead lets the current run through himself every time grammer gets on the phone . \\nfinally , and this covers the final hour of the movie , grammer has to lead his men ( and holly ) to overcome the other ships in a wargames exercise . \\nand he has to be a clever rebel to do it , in scenes that stretch all levels of believability . \\nfirst they\\'re singing \" louie louie \" like a bunch of drunk sailors to throw the radar of the other ship off , then thirty minutes later , they\\'re making whale mating noises to throw the radar of the other ship off . \\nthe whole while , evil captain coburn is overacting underwater , cursing grammer ( as most people watching the movie probably are too ) . \\nit\\'s all predictable without any original humor to redeem it . \\nthe jokes are right out of \" mchale\\'s navy \" and other cut-rate sitcoms of the past . \\nthere\\'s one scene where schneider looks through the ship\\'s pantry in disgust , holds one food can up and announces , \" this expired in 1966 ! \" \\ni yelled back at the screen , \" so did these jokes . \" \\ni watched this movie with the whole family and everyone hated it . \\nmy mom was so bored she brought out the coupon book midway through and , around the start of the second hour , i started writing my will . \\nthe blame can\\'t really be placed on the stars , though . \\nkelsey grammer is good in this , he just doesn\\'t have anything to work with . \\nhis character is said to have gotten so drunk one night that he had \" welcome aboard \" tatooed on his penis . \\ngrammer probably did something even worse -- got really drunk and agreed to appear in a movie he knew nothing about . \\nsame for holley ( save the penis part ) , who is likeable in down periscope just because she\\'s so gorgeous . \\nas for schneider ( whose character is downright annoying ) , there was nowhere to go but up after surf ninjas , although he\\'s still in the depths of the comedy ocean after jumping the \" snl \" ship . \\nmy theory is that down periscope is one of those movies that got the green light before the script was even written as a formula comedy ( \" okay , it\\'s police academy in the navy with frasier at the helm and the chick from dumb and dumber . \" ) and after everyone was signed on turned into a disaster . \\njudging from the video box , most other movie critics agree with me . \\nthe only quote the down periscope copy writers could dig up came from the prevue channel\\'s jim ferguson . \\ni guess even jeff craig from \" 60 second preview \" ( who said tank girl \" kicks butt ! \" \\nwithout ever seeing it ) didn\\'t like this . \\n',\n",
       " b\"i had a chance to see a sneak preview of city slickers ii on campus last night . \\ni went in with the expectation of a film with the similar flavor which made the original such a success : personal growth and insightful humor about life . \\ni came away somewhat disappointed in this regard , getting some of the latter and not much of the former . \\nthe basic plot revolves around billy crystal , who plays mitch robbins , turning forty . \\nhe's now become the station manager of the radio station in which he worked in the original . \\nhe's given a job at the radio station to his best friend , played by daniel stern , out of sympathy while stern's character works through his divorce . \\nhis loser younger brother ( john lovitz ) comes to mitch's house to bum a money and place to live , all while mitch and his wife try to celebrate his birthday . \\nduring the celebration , mitch discovers what appears to be a treasure map in curly's ( the cattle drive leader in the original played by jack palance ) old hat . \\nafter a business trip to las vegas , crystal , stern , and lovitz stay a few extra days to go off in search of the treasure . \\non the way , they run into curly's twin brother , duke , played by ( you know who ) jack palance . \\nfirst of all , the cinematography was beautifully done , especially the outdoor scenes in the desert . \\nthe scenes are such that i would like to see some of those sights filmed myself . \\nthere is some character development during the film . \\nthe actors remain true to their characters and play them well , without overplaying the jokes . \\nthe movie is a good basic adventure , with enough plot twists to provide for an ending that is difficult to predict . \\nthe movie is paced well , but with a couple slow spots in the middle and towards the end . \\nhumor-wise , the film has a good number of jokes which maintained my interest throughout the film . \\nthere are memorable moments like when stern is bitten by a snake , but there are fewer jokes to laugh at in the sequel ( surprise , surprise for a sequel , right ? ) . \\nhowever , the slight bitter aftertaste i have with this film has to do mainly with the film's manipulation of the audience . \\nthe film tries to pull your heart-strings too much regarding how close the characters are to each other , like when mitch had decided to suck the snake marrow out of his best friend's butt . \\nthis is done again when the gang meets up with some members of the cattle drive group from the original . \\nthere were also some parts which appeared unrealistic , like whether the stampede would start in the way it did or why they didn't worry more about water while tromping around the desert . \\nsome strenuous stretches of the imagination are required here . \\nsince the objective of the gang is to find gold and get rich ( unlike finding themselves in middle age like in the original ) , i also found it harder to empathize with the characters during their journey . \\noverall , i'd say that the film is an entertaining and humorous adventure with some story-line deficiencies making it less worthy than the original . \\nit may be worth the full price of admission , but a matinee would be a better bargain . \\n\",\n",

       " b'it is simply amazing how \" the green mile \" developed in its three hour running time . \\nbased on the stephen king series of the same title , the film starts out painfully slow , with underdeveloped characters and idiotic dialogue . \\nhowever , as the plot begins to progress , the film turns into pure perfection with outstanding performances and wonderful direction . \\nfrank darabont , who masterfully followed a prisoner\\'s story in \" the shawshank redemption \" , this time follows the perspective of a prison guard , paul edgecomb ( tom hanks ) . \\nthrough edgecomb\\'s experiences on a cell block known as the green mile where death row prisoners wait and repent , the audience sees good and evil on both sides of the law . \\nfrom an evil prison guard to an evil prisoner , \" the green mile \" is successful in creating sympathy for kind-hearted hard working guards and hard thinking prisoners . \\nthe plot follows edgecomb and four other guards as they meet a variety of prisoners and after having strong relationships with each eventually are forced to execute them . \\nthe performances by veterans and new comers to back up these original characters are superb . \\nthe ensemble acting in the film is perfect . \\nhanks , david morse and barry pepper as guards are wonderful and are fitting for their roles . \\nthey are the characters we most relate to because of their calm less extreme roles . \\nthey are given the positions to make rational decisions at difficult times and they are the ones who fulfill the demands of the audience . \\nthe more unique characters perfectly create friction on the green mile and make the story interesting and exciting . \\nsome particularly note worthy roles of the unique characters include doug hutchinson , sam rockwell , and michael duncan . \\nhutchinson , playing percy wetmore , a cowardly guard who hides his true feelings by tormenting others gives the greatest performance of the movie . \\nevery time he appears on the screen , the attitude of others is very uncomfortable and the creepy expressions he is able to create are effectively terrifying . \\nit would come as no surprise if hutchinson was nominated for an academy award as best supporting actor , not only because he did a wonderful job as wetmore , but also because he stole every scene he was in away from veteran oscar winner tom hanks . \\nrockwell , an independent film veteran , plays his role as wild bill wharton to perfection . \\nas a prisoner who taunts and harasses the guards at all hours , he really gets under your skin and irritates you for having to watch him torture others . \\nthis irritation he creates makes his performance so believable . \\nthe last noteworthy performance belongs to duncan , as the enormous convicted killer john coffey who happens to hold the power of curing the ill . \\nduncan does a wonderful job playing a frightened child-like behemoth , very similar to lennie small in of mice and men . \\nhis desire for love and the extinction of hate evokes the most compassion because it is very obvious that he is suffering for no just cause . \\nhis pain creates pain for the viewer . \\nhowever , it takes over an hour for duncan to be introduced completely in the film . \\nthe film opens with a ridiculous present day setting which contains a scene that jabs at \" the jerry springer show . \" \\nthe scene , containing one old man complaining about how all guests on the show are inbred and rednecks . \\nnot only is this observation entirely pointless and out of place , but it is also hackneyed beyond all belief . \\nas the film flashes back to 1935 , graham greene is quickly executed without any introduction . \\nhis death seems very rushed and without any knowledge of who he is , the scene is neither sad nor convincing . \\ngreene is not even given a final word , like some of the other characters , and we don\\'t even see him walk the infamous green mile . \\nhowever , as the film begins to specifically introduce more characters , such as coffey and eduard delacroix ( michael jeter ) as well as the five prison guards , the film becomes more interesting . \\nthe speed in \" the green mile \" is perfect . \\nif time was a matter of concern and the film was edited to the two hour mark , it would have been unsatisfactory because we would not be able to know the characters as they are or as they treat others . \\nthe three hour running is perfect for plot development and by the end of the film , a great amount of love or hate is attached to each character . \\n \" the green mile \" is so good following the rough beginning , that when the pivotal moment at the very end finally comes , it is almost impossible not to feel some sort of sadness for every person in this scene . \\nfighting back tears was a difficult task that i barely succeeded in doing . \\nif you survive the first third of \" the green mile \" sit back and enjoy the remainder for some priceless entertainment . \\n',\n",

\\nmeg ryan , america\\'s high school sweetheart , can act . \\nshe\\'s had a handful of memorable performances , including the great scene in the diner in when harry met sally ( i must not mention what she does , due to the , well , um , you get the idea , and if you don\\'t , get the movie-- fantastic ) . \\nbut , i like her best when she\\'s , well , perky . \\nshe is so adorably perky/cute that together with hanks , they are the most amazing onscreen duo in my short lifetime . \\nsome people have them going back to really old classic romantic couples , but i don\\'t really know . \\nall i know is that i just like them both . \\nthey have such wonderfully kinetic chemistry that\\'s really hard to resist , and i\\'m not going to even try . \\nthey\\'re just really , really cute , sweet , and charming . \\nhanks and ryan collaborate once again with nora ephron , who directed them in the megahit sleepless in seattle . \\nhere , the setup is a little different . \\nkathleen kelly ( ryan ) owns a small children\\'s bookstore which her mother founded 42 years ago and passed down to her . \\nshe is successful , beautiful , and dates a well-known columnist with very radical idea ( kinnear ) . \\nshe is also having an affair , of sorts . \\nyou see , kathleen , with the handle shopgirl , is secretly emailing ny152 . \\nthey have a strictly un-detailed relationship : there are no specifics , and they have no idea who each other is . \\nny152 happens to be joe fox ( hanks ) , a multimillionaire bookseller who is the heir to the fortune of the fox chain of mega-bookstores , run by his father ( coleman ) . \\nfox books has decided to open a store on the west side , right across from a little children\\'s bookseller named \" shop around the corner \" , run by a perky girl named kathleen kelly . \\nevery morning , these two email each other silly , and every day , they fight \" to the death ! ! \" . \\nit\\'s a charming premise , and one that works nicely , balancing the immense troubles kathleen is in with the romance she wants to have . \\nit also has the great sense of being a classic romance : there is no \" let\\'s have sex tonight \" mantra , if you\\'ll excuse my bluntness . \\nthis is a solid romance built around that vague concept of love . \\nhmm . well , the movie goes through twists and turns , having some sad moments and happy ones , until at one moment tom hanks and meg ryan \" hook up \" , to use modern terminology , and kiss their way into happiness . \\nyou know it\\'s going to happen , the question is now ? \\nthankfully , ephron has a wonderful supporting cast with posey , kinnear , chappelle , and a host of others , including a great scene involving brothers , aunts , and two sweet kids . \\nit\\'s all cute and wonderful , and for all of the idealism , it makes me feel good . \\nhanks is as obnoxious as ever on the outside and as warm on the inside as he always is . \\nhe is , i believe , america\\'s greatest actor . \\ndoes he show it here ? \\nnah . \\nbut he\\'s still tom hanks , and she\\'s still meg ryan . \\nwhich is what this movie boils down to . \\nit\\'s pure confection . \\nall the bits about the godfather , the jokes , the superb script , it\\'s all really sweet . \\nthere are some immense flaws , like pacing . \\nthe last third of the movie really doesn\\'t work as well as i would have liked , and for a romantic comedy , it\\'s slow . \\nonce hanks knows the secret , it gets really slow . \\ni even looked at my watch a couple times , to make sure ephron was going to deliver the big onscreen kiss i was waiting for , so that i could get home at a reasonable hour . \\nthe other problem is that this movie is shaping up to be really dated . \\ne-mail ? \\nwhen my kids are my age , i don\\'t know what we\\'ll be using . \\nbut hanks can do more with one eyeroll than anybody , and meg ryan just loves to dive into a pillow better than anyone in movie history . \\nthey just work together , and it\\'s nice to see . \\nit gives you , well , a smile . \\nthe script helps with some great lines that are absolutely hilarious , and that always come at the exact right time to keep the audience awake . \\ni was arguing with my father on the drive back home on what the purpose of movies was . \\ni\\'ve always believed that movies are very powerful , very powerful indeed . \\nyou see , mankind has three abilities he needs to survive : the ability to think , entertain , and procreate . \\nmovies can definitely do the first two , and as for the third , well , i\\'d rather not think about that . \\ni always thought films that made you think enlightened you and made you see something from another viewpoint , and that films that entertained you were good , because you forgot about your troubles and thought about something nice for a night . \\nand i was thinking about how incredible a year tom hanks has had . \\nhanks was the driving force behind one of the year\\'s best films in saving private ryan , which is one of those thinking films that truly made someone wonder about the world . \\nhe\\'s also half of the glue behind the year\\'s best example of pure entertainment . \\ntom hanks and meg ryan are magical , as is this movie . \\nit\\'s a sweet , lovely affair with a technology twist . \\nit may be a long commercial , but it gave me a pretty big smile on my face . \\n',\n",
       " b'this reviewer is ignorant of what hands were responsible for delivering the original version of the abyss in 1989 . \\nwhether it was the meddling of studio executives , or the work of writer/director james cameron himself , the original cut of this underwater sci-fi thriller was entertaining enough but also quite seriously flawed . \\nthe main problem was fairly simple : the film\\'s climax was unworthy of its build-up . \\nsomeone at 20th century fox - and no doubt cameron himself - must have agreed , because in 1993 came the theatrical release of the abyss : special edition . \\nnow available on video , it seems timely to re-evaluate what , in its newly revamped state , is now a near-masterpiece despite its borrowings from films like 2010 : odyssey two , alien and close encounters of third kind . \\nthe plot is thus . \\nwe meet the crew of an experimental underwater mobile oil rig designed by the hard-nosed lindsay ( mastrantonio ) and captained by her soon-to-be-divorced husband bud ( ed harris ) . \\nthe rig and its crew are diverted from their normal duties when the navy seeks their help in investigating the mysterious sinking of a u . s . nuclear submarine . \\nrequiring a dive part-way down a three mile deep trench , three navy divers arrive to command the operation , led by the edgy lieutenant coffey ( biehn ) . \\nbut a series of strange sightings soon convinces at least one member of the civilian crew that whoever or whatever they\\'re dealing with , as she memorably puts it , \" aren\\'t speaking russian \" . \\nmeanwhile on the surface a hurricane is brewing and , even worse , a series of incidents around cuba involving russians ships and an increasingly nervous u . s . navy sets off an international crisis of possible catastrophic proportions . \\nthis crisis is mirrored in the confines of the now isolated underwater rig , with the trigger-happy and increasingly paranoid lieutenant coffey at odds with the crew about how do deal with the mysterious goings-on around them . \\nthe human drama is often riveting , with the principal players performing with an intensity that recalls the fine ensemble acting in cameron\\'s aliens . \\nthe stunts , hardware , special effects and underwater cinematography are all outstanding . \\nand so they should be : cameron\\'s technical credentials are well established . \\nbut what ultimately makes the film so gripping is three intersecting plot strands : 1 ) the tension between old sparring partners lindsay and ex-hubby bud ; 2 ) the war of wills between the civilian crew and the navy divers as a series of escalating crisis\\' befall them ; and 3 ) the slowly unfolding revelation of what lies at the bottom of the three mile deep abyss . \\nthe abyss : special edition is an improvement on the original film in two major respects . \\none is that it further fleshes out the relationship between bud and lindsay , a relationship at times touching , at others incredibly intense and volatile . \\nthe second improvement is the restoration of some absolutely crucial scenes towards the film\\'s end , when the aliens demonstrate their control over water with a terrifying and extraordinary display of power to a world on the brink of nuclear war . \\nwith the inclusion of these startling scenes , the story\\'s climax is now given real weight . \\nwhy on earth were they left out of the original ? \\nthis reviewer finds it utterly incomprehensible . \\nso then , we have 25 minutes of additional footage that\\'s turned a decent underwater thriller into something quite magnificent . \\ni say \" quite \" because some flaws do remain . \\nthe most grating is several moments of corny hollywood schmaltz - some new , some old - that may well have you reaching for the barf bag . \\nnonetheless , the abyss : special edition now stands this somewhat maligned film among james cameron\\'s greatest achievements , alongside aliens and terminator 2 . see it and be moved , gripped and spellbound . \\n',\n",

       " b'this sunday afternoon i had the priviledge of attending a private screening at the sony astor cinema in new york city , of james cameron\\'s most heralded film , titanic . \\npostponed from last summer , with an escalated budget that makes it the most expensive movie in history , this was one film i was eager to preview . \\nso , is this movie going to sink or swim this holiday ? \\nmy best guess . . . . it will sink , though with many awards attatched to its hull . \\nno doubt , titanic is the most elaborate disaster movie ever made . \\nit boasts the most amazing effects that i have ever seen done to date . \\nto see a ship fall apart , with actual people running across the ship , flying across the deck , and falling to the water , is just amazing to look at . \\nthe effects are so stunningly realistic , you would swear you were looking at actual footage . \\nbut titanic is more than a disaster movie , and that\\'s where the problem lies . \\nthere is a love story attatched that nearly ruins the entire premise . \\ni\\'ll give a capsule summary of the story without spoiling anything for you : \\nthe film begins with a modern day excavation of sorts of the sunken titanic . \\nwe see actual footage of the sunken ship , as cammeron had set up special cameras to film the wreckage on the ocean floor . \\nbill paxton leads the expedition , in search of sunken treasure . \\nwhat he finds instead , leads him to a mysterious old woman who recounts her tale of the titanic voyage . \\nwe meet rose ( kate winslet ) , a young woman , who comes from an upper-class family . \\nrose is to be wed to a man she does not love . \\nwe meet jack ( leonardo dicaprio ) , a young man , who comes from a poor financial background , and wins a ticket aboard the titanic , in a poker game . \\nthe two meet under interesting circumstances , and the love story begins . \\nadd in a jealous fiance , and a not-so-nice law officer played by david warner , and you have a story that , well , gets a bit overplayed and oversappy . \\ni must add , at this point , that the most likeable character in the movie is played by kathy bates , as a woman with \" new money \" who is a lot less uptight than the other rich folk on the ship . \\nshe is a pleasure to see on screen . \\nwhen the ship does hit the iceberg at exactly 1 : 40 into the film , and eventually sinks , you never really feel for any of these characters . \\nthe film is just loaded with unlikeable rich snobs and other folk you never really get a grasp on . \\nthe effects are tremendous . \\nfrom the roars of gears and pumps in the engine room , to a doomed ship cracking at the seams , this is an effects picture that looks and sounds like no other . \\nwe saw titanic in dolby digital surround , and by far , it is the best sounding movie i have ever seen . \\nmy friend commented it was the best sound mix he has ever heard . \\nwhen people are in the water , at film\\'s end , you are surrounded by the voices of lost soles . \\ntitanic runs far too long . \\nthe movie is 3 hours and 15 minutes in length . \\nand , while most of the first 2 . 5 hours runs very fast and well-paced , the final 45 minutes almost comes to a sudden stop , and you realize that this sappy love story has to finish itself out before the movie finally ends . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong about titanic . . . . it\\'s \\nnot a bad as i am making it out to be . \\nit really is an exceptionaly well-made film . \\nthe costumes and sets are incredible , and true to the time period . \\nthe ship is painstakingly created exactly true to form , as we see actual pictures of the modern-day wreckage , transformed into the movie depiction . \\nthis film will certainly win on effects , costume , set design and sound . \\ncameron has certainly made his best film to date . \\nunfortunately , titanic is not a best picture candidate . \\nit just doesn\\'t have a strong supporting story . \\nit\\'s an exceptional disaster film with sappy filler inside . \\nit just doesn\\'t have the emotional impact that i suspect mr . cameron was shooting for . \\ni predict that titanic will open to likeable reviews . \\nit is a film worth seeing . \\ni predict that it will only do moderately well at the box office . \\nwith its extreme running time , and lack of enough robust to get substantial word-of-mouth , i expect that it will do even better on home video . \\nthis will certainly be the definitive ac3 movie for all you home theater enthusiasts . \\ntitanic opens december 19th , and is released by paramount pictures and twentieth century-fox . \\ni give titanic 3 stars ( . \\nthat\\'s not bad . \\nron epstein \\nriginally posted in home theater forum === \\n',\n",
       " b\"my giant begins with a monologue that's more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride , ' medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel . \\ni was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was , with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream . \\nand when sammy meets max , his giant , mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan , there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy , i loved every minute of it . \\nthe film , of course , plays on the size difference between the two , and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects . \\ni particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons . \\ni also liked jere burns' ( from tv's `something so right' ) performance as the director of the film in romania . \\nat this point , the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand , particularly during his fast-paced first scene . \\nit is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate , as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech . \\nhowever , about the time muresan becomes coherent , the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive . \\noff the high board . \\nsuddenly , we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball . \\nup until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure , but he didn't come off as a desperate jerk . \\nif he had , the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical . \\nbut now , in new york , we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son , and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match , which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film . \\nindeed , many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces . \\nthis includes the scenes featuring steven seagal , when sammy gets max a role in a big , hollywood movie filming in las vegas . \\nwhile i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself , the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation , rather than because the film demanded it . \\nand the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare . \\nat this point i found myself thinking , `we're supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ? ' \\nthen i realized he was , and i was watching it . \\nin the final third , the film undergoes another transformation , this time to unbridled sentimentality . \\nnote : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph . \\nmax went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love , lillianna , who hasn't seen him since he was a normal-sized kid . \\nher refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means' scene as sammy's wife serena , played nicely by kathleen quinlan , poses as lillianna . \\ni found this scene offensive . \\nnot only did it rely on deception to induce warm , fuzzy feelings from the audience , it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle , which i thought was quite undeserved . \\ni think max could have handled the truth , gratuitous illness and all . \\nlate in the film we learn max , and in fact all giants , have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably . \\nthis could be an enlightening revelation , but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammy's transformation into a caring , sensitive guy -- and hey , a great dad and husband , too ! \\n`my giant' suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions . \\na stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on max's struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammy's struggles to get money and become a better person . \\nin this scenario , max's illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator . \\nsentiment and emotion would have followed naturally . \\ninstead , we're apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end , but we're not allowed to focus on max . \\ncrystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances , but in the end , `my giant' left me feeling like i'd been fed gruel from a giant spoon . \\n\",\n",

       " b\"i wonder if budget is at all a criterion for whether or not a movie can be considered an exploitation flick . \\ntake the professional , for example . \\nit boasts extremely glossy cinematography , a couple of recognizable name actors , and a couple of fairly impressive explosions . \\nit's also basically about violence and cheap titilation , and features a central relationship between a middle-aged man and a twelve-year-old girl with a decidedly ambiguous sexual dimension . \\nthe professional is all over the map , and its pretensions of being about anything more than its most unpleasant elements simply make it all the more unpleasant . \\nthe professional of the title is a new york hit man named leon ( jean reno ) , brutally efficient but also very isolated . \\none day he is forced to let someone into his life when a girl from his apartment building knocks on his door . \\nher name is matilda ( natalie portman ) , and the rest of her family has just been killed by crooked and very wired d . e . a . \\nagent norman stansfield ( gary oldman ) after matilda's father tried to rip him off . \\nleon reluctantly takes matilda in , then begins to teach her his profession when she says that she wants to avenge the murder of her young brother . \\nthe two become closer , which makes them all the more vulnerable when stansfield learns that they know too much , and sets out to eliminate them both . \\nwriter/director luc besson has gone this route before with his popular french import la femme nikita , a slick potboiler about a female assassin . \\nthere is no question that besson can make a great * looking * film ; with the assistance of cinematographer thierry arbogast , he has created a film chock full of moody close-ups and evocative lighting . \\nbut beneath the shiny wrapper , there isn't nearly as much going on as besson would like us to believe . \\nthe relationship between leon and matilda never clicks because neither one is given a character to develop . \\nleon is mostly a collection of quirky traits , all intended to show us that for a hired killer , he's really not so bad a guy : he drinks lots of milk , takes meticulous care of a potted plant , and enjoys gene kelly movies . \\njean reno succeeds at giving leon a haunted and desperate quality , but he never makes an emotional connection to matilda . \\nnatalie portman is all wrong for a part that called for a much grittier quality , but she doesn't have too much to work with , either . \\nbesson would have been better served spending more time trying to bring his characters to life , and less on feeble attempts at humor which are often embarrassing . \\na silly game between leon and matilda involving celebrity impersonations is completely out of place , as is a scene where matilda shocks a hotel manager by announcing that leon is her lover ; character is thoroughly sacrificed for a cheap gag . \\ngary oldman's entire part is something of a cheap gag , wild-eyed and way over the top , but at least he is interesting to watch . \\nthere isn't a real person to be found anywhere in the professional , which isn't always a problem in an action thriller , except that this one is trying to pass itself off as something more . \\na more disconcerting problem with the professional is that it plays around with the sexuality of a twelve-year-old in a really distasteful way . \\nthere were only two real choices for dealing with that component of leon and matilda's relationship : confront it head on , or ignore it entirely . \\nbut besson flirts and teases the audience with the idea that he's going to show them a forbidden love story , while choosing simply to focus his camera on portman's rear end and dress her in skimpy clothing . \\nthis is to say nothing of the questionable decision to make it look like quality paternal time when leon is teaching a child to load a 9mm pistol , or the blood which is spilled aplenty . \\na great deal of the time , the professional is just plain sleazy , and all the soft filters in the world can't disguise that fact . \\n\",\n",

\\nokay , maybe the last one was a bit nit-picky , but hey , i was on a roll . \\nbroderick is usually a good actor , but in this film he\\'s weighed down by an unexciting character and an atrocious screenplay which seem to fight against him every step of the way . \\nhank azaria does what he can , but don\\'t expect to see development of any of the promise he showed in the birdcage . \\nlike broderick\\'s , azaria\\'s character is quite simply lacking in color . \\nwhat really annoyed me was maria pitillo , who actually takes the bad script and makes it worse with her acting . \\ncasting must have been asleep on this one . \\nthe one bright spot here is jean reno , who oddly enough seems to fit well into a role which is often comedic , quite unlike what we\\'ve seem him do in the past . \\nalthough his character is contradictory to the unfolding disaster , reno brings a style to the role of phillipe which makes him enjoyable . \\nunfortunately , the same cannot be said of the other incongruities . \\nthe entire feel of the movie is tongue-in-cheek , and seems to pay comical homage to a dozen or so films that have come before it . \\nthis results in a significant amount of parody , which contrasts sharply with the threat of the monster , and ends up just producing a mess . \\nmost of the characters seem to be there for comic relief , and almost none are smart enough for the audience to take seriously . \\nalthough emmerich obviously wanted to make a fun action picture , what good is it to sink millions into a cgi creature whose ferocity is undermined by the humans he threatens ?

marriage is a loving one . \\nthe marriage will symbolize the clash of cultures in modern israel between the native israeli\\'s modern viewpoint toward religion and the political savvy hasidic\\'s intolerable one , as both groups are vying for control of the secular government . \\ngitai ( devarim/yom yom ) is a labor party leftist , who believes that if the rigid hasidic ever got control of the government , it would sound the death knell of israel . \\nthe emphasis of the film is on how the ultra-orthodox jews of that sect live by the letter of the torah in everything they do and how they subjugate the women to accept their vision of god\\'s law from only the male\\'s view . \\nthat if they ever got control of the country , their intolerant attitude would subjugate the country the same way the women are . \\nthe story takes place in jerusalem\\'s jewish quarters called mea shearim , where we are taken down sinewy back streets with placards pasted on the walls , and into the crowded apartments and prayer rooms where the protagonists live out their idea of the proper jewish life , which is much different than the way most jews live in israel . \\nthis is a controversial film , in that the women are unhappy and the male attitudes are to such an extreme patriarchal ones , that the film is bound to anger most viewers , no matter their belief . \\nit is a slow-moving , meticulous film , that grabs hold of you by the collar and never lets go . \\nthe force of what is seen , though filmed in an objective manner , never taking a cheap shot at the hasidim , is nevertheless bound to leave questions about the nature of such a practice of strict observance . \\nthe film is meant to be critical of such a rigid people , as it implies how they kill the spirit of everything they touch and with their extreme phobic attitudes , it makes it impossible for them to unite the country when they can\\'t at present live in harmony with their own people , and it would be even more impossible to imagine them living with their arab neighbors in peace . \\nthe film opens as meir rises at dawn and goes through his prayer ritual , where every prayer is made to the virtues of god . \\nhe even thanks god that he didn\\'t make him a woman . \\nhis wife rivka accepts the fate she was born into and looks at him from the next bed where she sleeps separately according to hasidic custom . \\nshe looks at him with glistening eyes , not questioning the laws or rebelling against her secondary role and how her religion keeps her from studying the talmud and having all the modern conveniences of life , and from seeing movies and tv . \\nmeir is a talmudic scholar . \\nhis father ( abu warda ) is a rabbi at the yeshiva . \\nhe has been married for ten years and his wife has not been able to give him a child . \\nsince the hasidim look upon a woman\\'s role in life being only to conceive children , and cook and clean house for the man , while the man\\'s role is to spend his time in prayer , therefore there is an insurmountable problem in this otherwise loving marriage . \\nshe receives an anonymous letter that states \" a woman without a child is no better than dead . \" \\nmeir\\'s response , is that it is written like that in the talmud . \\nmeir\\'s father tells him that the marriage contract must be broken : \" a man who dies without progeny rips a page from the torah . \" \\nall the blame is placed on rivka , who is thought of as unpure as the reason for her being barren . \\nshe will go through countless ritual baths to cleanse herself , as her rigid mother ( koenig ) dunks her in the holy water and says a ritual prayer for the 12 times she is dunked as an homage to the 12 tribes of israel . \\ntheir religion doesn\\'t permit them to be examined extensively by a doctor . \\nrivka goes on the sly and finds out that it is her husband who is sterile , but she cannot tell him that because of their religion . \\nso when meir\\'s father chooses a younger woman for his son , she is exiled to live alone in a cold apartment in the same jewish quarters . \\nrivka\\'s spirited younger sister malka does not want to get married but wants to live a more liberated life . \\nshe has a long time romantic relationship with a fellow hasidic yaakov . \\nbut , because of the way they were both raised , she is still a virgin . \\nwhen yaakov joined the israeli army to fight in lebanon , something his sect is not allowed to do , he is thereby banished from the sect even though he is still a believer . \\nhe now works as a singer in a nightclub . \\nmalka\\'s mother is worried that her daughter won\\'t get married , so she arranges with the rabbi for her to marry yossef , someone whom she doesn\\'t love . \\nyossef is a very stern follower of the order , he is also a political activist who drives around the city in a sound-truck with a bull-horn urging jews to stick together and fight their godless enemies . \\nthe two sisters are close and languidly discuss their options , with rivka telling her sister to accept the marriage , it will make her happy ; but , while malka is reluctantly forced into accepting it , she has other plans to ruin this bogus marriage . \\nthe harshest scene in the film is on malka\\'s wedding night . \\nyossef prays to god for a child and then robotically gets malka to spread her legs , and without the least bit of affection , only a nervousness shown on his part for the function he supplies , as he goes inside her and rams her hard , thrusting away until the act is completed and then retiring without a word or gesture of love . \\nthe sisters have choices , like everyone else in life does . \\nbut the choices are obliterated by one\\'s beliefs , circumstances , and inward nature , and how difficult it is to carry out those choices if it goes completely against the way one is brought up . \\nfor the sisters , the choices are life or death ones . \\ngitai by closing in on the daily rituals , tight living quarters and close-knit community , has shown how difficult these choices are for those who have never seen another world and have been kept in the dark all their life . \\nthe film ends with the forlorn malka walking atop of jerusalem and looking down upon it as an outsider would , and everything seems strange to her , all the things she once thought of as being set in stone are now harsh memories , as she has made her choice , and the price of that choice is very heavy indeed . \\n',\n",

was released , \" at first sight \" is not quite as strong since it is not directed with as sure a hand as penny marshall , but is still an intelligent and vibrantly-acted drama . \\nthe film begins as amy ( mira sorvino ) , a stressed-out new york architect , decides to take some time off and travel upstate to the country . \\nat the hotel she is staying at , she makes a massage appointment and after a long , soothing session which ends with her crying as a release of emotions , she strikes up a conversation with the handsome masseur virgil ( val kilmer ) , only to find out later that he is actually blind . \\namy doesn\\'t really care if he has a handicap or not , and begins to spend time with him more and more until they finally start to fall in love . \\nonce she has returned to new york , amy begins to research on virgil\\'s certain type of retinal blindness , which he has had since three years of age , and out of a stroke of luck , comes into contact with a doctor ( bruce davison ) who believes he can repair virgil\\'s sight , even though there have only been thirty similar cases in history . \\nat first reluctant , virgil finally travels with amy to nyc and agrees to the surgery , much to the hesitance of his overbearing , but loving older sister ( kelly mcgillis ) . \\nultimately , the surgery is a success , but problems arise since virgil cannot relate to what he sees , since he has never visually seen anything before , only touched objects . \\nhe moves into amy\\'s apartment and she is eager to stand by him , but virgil\\'s maladjustment begins to put a strain on their relationship . \\non the basis of the overall story , \" at first sight \" is indeed a film that has been done many times before , and owes a great deal to its predecessor , \" awakenings . \" \\nwhat will happen throughout the film can also be easily telegraphed in advance . \\nhowever , what helps \" at first sight \" rise above this predictability is in the mature and intelligent relationship that develops between virgil and amy . \\nusually , romantic pictures are of the shameless puppy-dog sort ( the recent tom hanks/meg ryan-starrer \" you\\'ve got mail \" immediately pops to mind ) , but with this film , i grew to care more about the characters and their plight . \\nthe film starts off noticably well as amy travels up north and first meets virgil . \\nthe massaging sequences were strangely erotic , maybe even more so than the later actual \" love scenes , \" and as their romantic involvement quickly developed , the film was both entertaining and sweet , and there was clearly a lot of chemistry between the two . \\nthese joyous moments early on balanced out well with the later scenes in which their relationship is seriously tested due to a contrast in the life styles that they have always known , with virgil completely used to being blind and having a comforting , peaceful life in the country to amy\\'s eventful life in the \" big city . \" \\nthe other major compliment that must be given to the film are the nearly flawless performances across the board . \\nval kilmer , usually cast in the \" macho \" type of role , was always believable as a blind person , and playing his character was probably a little more tricky than it appears . \\nit was up to kilmer to not come off as someone to pity , but to sympathize with , and he pulled it off . \\nmira sorvino , who made a spectacular debuting splash in 1995\\'s hilarious woody allen comedy , \" mighty aphrodite , \" for which she won a well-deserved oscar as a kind-hearted , but ditzy hooker , is a standout here . \\nalthough she has made some mediocre film choices since then ( 1997\\'s \" mimic , \" 1998\\'s \" the replacement killers \" ) , she always has managed to come out unscathed , and it is with \" at first sight \" that she finally has another juicy role to play . \\nin a truthful climactic scene set in amy\\'s apartment between she and virgil , sorvino proves to be one of the most gifted young actresses around today , and has a flare for both comedic and dramatic pieces . \\nkelly mcgillis , who could have easily come off as the \" bad , \" one-dimensional sister , instead is also given an unexpectedly multifaceted character to play as a woman who may be overly protective but simply cares for her brother . \\nfinally , nathan lane , who is usually a little too over-the-top , is appropriately restrained as a vision therapist . \\nthe one misstep of \" at first sight \" is in its treatment of the medical procedure done on virgil . \\nvery little is ever said or discussed concerning it , and when the surgery occurs , it is so briefly glimpsed at that it is impossible to see what is being done to his eyes . \\nperhaps the reason this aspect of the film was not more in-depth was that the makers were afraid it would gross out audiences , but i would personally take realism , even if it is graphic , any day over simply giving the explanation of the surgery the cold shoulder . \\nin \" awakenings , \" the patients and illness were far more satisfyingly portrayed . \\nbecause of how strong the screenplay , written by steve levitt , is in the way it deals with the main relationship , and because of the fabulous performances from kilmer and sorvino , the film\\'s few problems can be swept over to the side . \\nthe adult way that the romance is depicted by director irwin winkler is , no doubt , in respect to the real-life couple that the film was inspired by , who are still together after many years ( even though the setting of the film was changed to new york ) . \\nsince january is usually the time of year that is known as the dumping ground from bad movies , \" at first sight \" comes as a refreshing and sophisticated change of pace . \\n',\n",

\\nmaybe he felt it would be interesting playing the devil , and you can tell he is having fun doing so , but his skill as an actor cannot save the poor performances and lackluster script that surround him . \\nit\\'s pretty standard stuff , including the fact that the hotshot lawyer appears to be the only competent person on the planet who can do anything right in the courtroom . \\nplease read no further if you do not want the ending spoiled , but i have to get something off of my chest . \\nin 1986 i remember watching a movie called \" wisdom \" with emilio estevez and demi moore , and the ending of that film did the worst possible thing that a movie could do . \\nwhat i like to call \" guess what , it was all a dream \" scenario . \\nin \" wisdom \" the two lead characters are killed at the end , only to have one of the characters \" wake up \" from an apparent and say \" gosh , i\\'m glad that didn\\'t really happen ! \" . \\ni considered it inexcusable the way the audience was toyed with . \\nwell , the same thing happens in \" the devils advocate \" , and although arguments could be made surrounding whether it was actually a dream ( perhaps milton went back in time to try a different route for his plan , since it failed and he is the devil ) , but the point is that the last 90% of the film didn\\'t happen . \\ni know it\\'s a stretch , after all it is a movie and nothing really happened , but i just get annoyed to get toyed with like that . \\nof course , the dream ending could almost be forgiven if the story that precedes it was at least an interesting one . \\nas i recall , \" wisdom \" was a decent film . \\n \" the devil\\'s advocate \" is not . \\nthe devils advocate \\ndirected by taylor hackford john milton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . al pacino kevin lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . keanu \\nreeves mary ann lomax . . . . . . . . . . . charlize \\ntheron mrs . lomax . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . judith \\nivey eddie barzoon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . jeffrey jones christabella . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . connie \\nnielson \\nwritten by randy turgeon , march 18 , 1998 . \\n',\n",
       " b'synopsis : private detective tom welles is hired by a wealthy widow to uncover the origins of a snuff film owned by her late husband . \\nafter uncovering the authenticity of the film , welles descends into an underground world of perverse pornographers seeking vigilante revenge on the filmmakers . \\ncomments : 8 mm is one of the more disturbing mainstream movies i have seen in a long time . \\nthough it doesn\\'t present a snuff film ( a movie which documents a person\\'s murder for real , usually during or after some form of sexual act ) as explicitly as the cult classic mute witness and violence as shockingly as , say , natural born killers , 8 mm stays in your head long after you see it . \\nit is not fun to watch ; see something else if you get upset by realistic , sadistic violence . \\nthis film\\'s violence and perverse sexuality skirts closely into nc-17 territory . \\nfor those with strong stomachs , however , 8 mm is an intelligent , worthwhile thriller , especially during its second hour . \\nnicolas cage , after a couple ho-hum movies , returns to material which allows him to utilize his strong acting abilities . \\nas tom welles , a private detective and caring family man to a wife and newly-born daughter , cage skillfully and convincingly portrays a decent man whose unwavering energy slowly transforms into obssession and violence as he is pulled into a nightmarish world of underground pornographers and brutal sexual deviants . \\nserving as a guide to this world is joaquin phoenix , who plays a struggling songwriter named max california . \\ncalifornia , despite his name , is a surprisingly intelligent and complex character , and phoenix does a very good job at slowly pulling the audience to sympathy for the character . \\nthe real star of the movie , though , must be peter stormare . \\nstormare played the \" really , really evil guy \" in fargo , and his character , dino velvet , in this movie seems about ten times more evil and unpredictable . \\nhis performance is very chilling . \\n8 mm\\'s success may hardly be surprising . \\nit was directed by joel schumacher , who , hopefully , saw this film as an apology for the absolutely dreadful batman and robin . \\nbefore directing the last two batman duds , however , schumacher was responsible for several well-made horror flicks : lost boys , flatliners , and falling down . \\n8 mm certainly joins the rank of these minor classics and is perhaps most reminiscent of falling down in that both films present an average man who self-destructs before the audience\\'s eyes . \\n8 mm was written by andrew kevin walker , who also penned the academy award-winning thriller seven a few years back . \\nlike seven , 8 mm is full of dialogue which haunts you well after leaving the theater . \\nwelles is searching for answers . \\nhow could anyone possibly drug and then slowly , methodically , sadistically kill a teenaged girl to make a film ? \\nwhen confronting one of the perpretrators at the end , the murderer responds that there are no reasons . \\nhe just enjoys it . \\nthat , walker seems to suggest , is where the real terror lays : not in the crime itself but in the fact that rational motives do not exist . \\na couple minor faults led me to my four-star rating ( five stars is the highest rating i give ) . \\none , i found it a little difficult , early on , to accept the fact that a hardened private detective would get physically disgusted when first seeing a snuff film . \\nyes , snuff is a horrible thing , but a detective of welles\\' caliber has probably encountered awful things before . \\nsecond , some of the clues welles gathers are too convenient . \\nhe discovers , for example , the victim\\'s diary in her private bathroom , despite the fact the the police , the fbi , and her own mother have all investigated the room before . \\nfinally , the closing scene seemed trite and improbable considering the rest of the film . \\ndespite the above criticisms , 8 mm is an engrossing story . \\none of the best scenes in the film occurs toward the end as a crazed welles , who no longer seems like a hero , brutally beats one of the pornographers responsible for the snuff film . \\nhe pulls a gun on the man and , for a relatively long amount of time , struggles to decide whether or not to kill him . \\nhe then leaves the building and calls the victim\\'s mother , in the middle of the night , to basically see if she would support the action . \\nthe entire scene is tense , unpredictable , and emotionally charged . \\nrarely , anymore , do horror films or thrillers provoke suspense in me as 8 mm , with scenes like this , did . \\n8 mm is most certainly not for the faint of heart . \\nthis is a graphic , oftentimes unflinching , look into the darkness which resides in both ordinary and extraordinary people . \\nif you\\'re prepared for a film of this nature , i give it an enthusiastic recommendation . \\n',\n",
       " b'guilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller , basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living . \\nbut i know so well that it\\'s a terrible film , made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt . \\nverhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and , on november seventh , 1997 , unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me , who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies . \\nthe pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year . \\na simple , white on black title card reads \" starship troopers \" -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped , verhoeven realized he forgot the credits . \\nis this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ? \\nwere the rest of the film that subdued . . . \\nstarship troopers is about a group of white , blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names . \\nthey graduate high school , join the military , and then , rather curiously , decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet . \\nthe story is so incomprehensible , and told so bombastically , it\\'s akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue . \\n ( aside , club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasn\\'t changed in the future . ) \\none plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences , specifically the newsreels of the future . \\nhysterically funny , actually . \\nbut the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between . \\nthe storytelling lacks focus , to say the least . \\nthe politics of the film are scary . \\nthe actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos . \\nthere\\'s even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out , nude , with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater , just the way he seems to like it . \\ni use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor i\\'ve encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo , he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders . \\nof course , verhoeven\\'s probably the one to blame , and perhaps i\\'m jealous because i\\'m so disgusting . \\nat any rate , a movie called starship troopers shouldn\\'t be about sex . \\nexactly ten years ago , verhoeven made robocop , which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving . \\nand r-rated , despite its goofy premise . \\nmaybe it\\'s asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie , then-he\\'s a master of insipid violence . \\nhowever , ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it . \\n',\n",
       " b'the film \" magnolia \" can be compared to a simple flower as its title and movie poster suggests . \\nthe dozens of characters introduced and developed are like the petals on the flower . \\nthey all come from the same stem and as the flower begins to develop they grow farther and farther apart . \\nthe numerous characters in the film are all closely connected no matter how different they are from one another socially . \\nfrom a humiliated but kind cop to an aging game show host , each one of these characters is suffering the same kind of pain . \\nthey are each seriously lonely and seek the perfect companion to end this loneliness . \\nwhether this companion is a distant family member or a spouse , each character begs for one and spends the whole film searching for the perfect one . \\n \" magnolia \" is a clever , well thought out film from prodigy director-writer paul thomas anderson of \" boogie nights \" fame . \\nthe detailed character analyses and the powerful script make \" magnolia \" memorable . \\nhowever , what really is impressive is that even though there are tons of characters in several unrelated stories , the film is never confusing . \\nanderson\\'s control over transitioning from one story to another story is masterful . \\nhe also knows exactly when to cut to another subplot since not one of \" magnolia\\'s \" scenes drag on too long . \\nany three hour film that does not deliver even one uninteresting scene is definitely worth recommending . \\nfrom the fascinating beginning to the risky yet surprisingly satisfying ending the film just doesn\\'t get boring . \\nit is obvious that anderson put a lot of time into connecting each subplot . \\nthis is the ultimate game of six degrees of separation . \\nevery character is connected to every other character by at the most two degrees . \\nfor example , cop john c . reilly is connected to game show host phillip baker hall through hall\\'s daughter melora walters who once went on a date with reilly . \\nthe fact that each character is so different from the others yet so similar shows that there are universal pains that all classes , races , and genders suffer . \\nanderson\\'s explanation to prove this point is both accurate and convincing . \\nthe only mistake anderson made in trying to connect his characters was by making his actors all sing an aimee mann song simultaneously . \\nthis was foolish not only because it was unbelievable and hilariously erroneous but also because it had a broadway musical feel to it and this movie is about as far apart from your typical broadway musical than you can get . \\nthe performances in \" magnolia \" are perfection . \\nthis is a classic example of flawless casting and flawless ensemble acting . \\nanderson allows many of hollywood\\'s best supporting actors to blossom at what they do best , character acting . \\nall of the main characters in each story are perfect because they are able to reveal more emotions and attitudes in their brief time on the screen then most movie stars can do in a feature length film . \\nworth noting is tom cruise , who stepped out of his usual superficial starring role and into a funny but depressing tour de force performance . \\nhe was probably noticed more than the other actors in the film by award givers because his role here is so much different and impressive than those in the past ( however any actor in this film could be nominated for best supporting actor without any complaints ) the only problem i had with the acting was that a few of the characters felt seriously edited down such as melinda dillon\\'s character as phillip baker hall\\'s wife . \\nshe seemed to be thrown in towards the end and i felt very little sympathy for her because i had not seen her enough earlier in the film . \\n \" magnolia \" uses several effective metaphors to describe its characters . \\nanderson has the talent to make the audience sympathetic towards numerous people in only a few hours . \\nto see that anderson is able to perfectly portray this many different types of people shows that he has a keen sense of diversity . \\ndiversity is what makes a director successful for a long period of time . \\ni predict a lot of diversity and success from anderson in the future . \\n',\n",
       " b'there seem to be two reactions to dark city . \\nyou either love it or you are unimpressed . \\ncount me as a \" love it . \" \\nas good as the crow and spawn are , dark city is better . \\nwhere the former two have a specific comic-book following , the latter is an original work with the potential for broader appeal . \\nit has a similar look to the others , but dark city is much more thoughtful and much less violent . \\nnot clever or complex , the story is still fascinating , like a selection from the twilight zone . \\na man ( rufus sewell ) is awakened in his bathtub by a man with a syringe . \\nsurprised , the attacker runs off . \\nthe dazed man gets out of the tub and finds a woman\\'s body in the room . \\na mysterious caller warns him to leave the apartment immediately , so he packs some clothes and leaves , never sure why he\\'s leaving or what he\\'s fleeing . \\nghoulish figures in long coats recognize the man and chase him through the dark city , hounding him like figures in a nightmare . \\nan odd blast of willpower allows the man to dream himself free from his pursuers long enough to check his i . d . \\nthe amnesiac learns that he is not dreaming and that his name is john murdoch . \\nnow if only he could remember the rest of his life . . . . \\ndark city is good on many levels . \\nfirst , the look of the movie is excellent . \\ngive credit to production designers george liddle and patrick tatopolous for creating a coherent look from diverse elements . \\nthere are visual elements from the american 1920s-60s , mixed with dickens-era urban industrial elements . \\nit is all pulled together in a sad , dark look reminiscent of the diner in edward hopper\\'s painting , nighthawks . \\nproyas\\' use of models gives an appropriately eerie unreality to the film\\'s world ( for not only does the audience see the city a model , but so do the ghouls ) . \\nthe look is like a cross between tim burton\\'s batman and the bleak animation of the brothers quay . \\nsecond , the editing of the film is good . \\nthe pacing is on track , and the plot is revealed , the \" amnesia \" explained , in satisfying increments . \\nalso , the stylized editing within each scene gives the movie a tense , caffeinated look . \\nthird , the special effects are well used . \\nthey look good , but more importantly , the right effects are used for the right job . \\none example stands out in my mind : the coated figures who haunt the city can attack telekinetically . \\na simple ripple effect is used . \\na more showy effect could have been chosen , but then it would have just been gratuitous . \\nrestraint was shown where necessary , letting the more critical effects look more impressive . \\nfinally , like gattaca , dark city spends a just a little effort striving for mythical significance . \\nunlike gattaca , the story is just open-ended and non-literal enough to be successful . \\njohn murdoch\\'s recovery from amnesia is tied to the passing of the night , and the hopeful coming of the dawn . \\nhis struggle with amnesia is both figuratively and literally the struggle of all mankind ( at least in his world ) . \\nwhen we finally see the big picture of the movie\\'s world , it is as mysterious as the iroquois image of the world being carried on the back of a giant turtle . \\na few minor flaws keep me from giving this movie the same perfect score roger ebert gave , but i do strongly recommend it , for its look , its pace , its story , and its timelessness . \\n',\n",

       " b'if there\\'s one thing in common about all of hollywood\\'s major studios , it\\'s that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more . \\nalthough twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively ) , it\\'s obvious there\\'s no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater . \\nso when a movie like gary ross\\' pleasantville comes along , wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production , it\\'s a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes . \\nalthough the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted , pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie . \\nquite the opposite is true , in fact , as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen . \\nthe story , both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation , captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema . \\nnot in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution , and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross\\' work , it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough . \\nkudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture . \\nit stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who , through quite a bit of luck , find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named \" pleasantville . \" \\nmaguire , as the reserved bud parker , is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times . \\nit\\'s not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end , and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like . \\nsoon hues of color creep into the black and white world , and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism , others fear the strangeness . \\nat one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t . \\nwalsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town . \\nfine performances are turned in all around . \\nmaguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads , but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t . \\nwalsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) . \\ndaniels brings an atmosphere of awe , inspiration , and hope to his character , whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackman\\'s envy . \\nfor daniels , it\\'s his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh , it\\'s a complementary exclamation point on a fine career . \\nalso of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen , and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish . \\nthere\\'s not much to dislike about pleasantville , and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who don\\'t . \\n',\n",

is part of the seti ( search for extraterrestrial intelligence ) project . \\nher research is quickly killed , however , by her highly political david drumlin ( tom skerrit ) , who disdains \" pure research \" in favor of science with \" commercial applications . \\nshe goes in search of private funding and is turned down at every step until she pitches her project to a corporation run by the mysterious s . r . \\nhadden ( john hurt ) . \\nthen , with that money just about to finally dry up , ellie is sitting out in the desert near the very large array in new mexico when she hears over her headphones a very powerful pulsing radio signal . \\nin the movie\\'s most exciting and believable sequence , ellie and her coworkers determine that the signal has to be coming from the star vega . \\nat first the signal appears to be just sequences of prime numbers , then it turns out to be a tv signal of the berlin olympics bounced back to earth from 50 years before . \\nfurther decoding , with hadden\\'s help , reveals another layer to message , containing detailed plans for a massive and complex machine . \\nit appears that the machine is a transport that will allow one person to travel to the aliens\\' home world . \\nof course , the big question becomes \" who gets to ride it ? \" \\n ( right after \" who\\'s gonna pay for this thing ? \" ) . \\nto boil it down , ellie gets denied the seat in the machine because she bluntly acknowledges her atheism , while drumlin gets to go because he rather insincerely professes his deep religious faith . \\ndrumlin is killed and the machine destroyed when religious fanatics bomb the launch platform ( apparently to keep \" godless science \" from talking to god , or something like that ) . \\nthen hadden reappears with startling news . \\nhe has secretly constructed a second machine off the coast of japan and has reserved the ride for ellie , in whom he has taken a rather paternal interest . \\nellie boards the machine and is transported through some kind of wormhole to a dream-like place that looks a lot like waikiki beach before they built the hotels , where she meets the aliens who take the form of her late father ( david morse ) . \\nwhen she returns home , no one believes her . \\nshe was not even gone for one second , they say , even though she remembers being gone for 18 hours . \\nher story is officially discredited , although believed by a large segment of the public ( who don\\'t even have to know that her computer records of the trip contain nothing but static . \\n . \\n . \\neighteen hours worth of static ) . \\nthere is a lot to like about contact so i will highlight those points first . \\nellie arroway is a well-rounded character portrayed by one of the best actresses currently working . \\nneither the character nor the performance has the same depth as clarice starling in silence of the lambs , but that\\'s a tough standard to meet . \\nellie is interesting in that she is woman defined by a strange array of father figures . \\nher real father is an idealized movie dad who does nothing in the film but love his daughter unconditionally . \\ndrumlin comes across as a distant stepfather to whom ellie is like an irritating teenager who wants to use his toys to get into trouble . \\nhadden obviously has affection for ellie , but in the end he seems to see her as his creation , nothing more than his favorite piece on the chess board . \\neven palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , ellie\\'s love interest , takes a paternalistic interest in ellie , seeing her as a misguided person who needs protection from her own impulses . \\nthe film is technically impressive , especially in the scenes where the message is first received and during the destruction of the first machine . \\nthe part of the film dealing with the message has the best presentation of real science in a film since the andromeda strain . \\nthe film falls apart when dealing with its central theme , the dichotomy between science and religion . \\nthis is a very real debate but contact boils it down to a simplistic level that never really touches on the actual issues involved . \\nthe film presents science pretty well ( until the end ) so the real problem stems from it presentation of religious faith . \\nreligious people are presented as shallow caricatures . \\nrob lowe plays a ralph reed clone named richard rank ( very subtle , guys ) , the voice of the religious right . \\nanother religious figure is the fanatic who blows up the first machine ( jake busey ) . \\nthe only really fleshed-out religious person , palmer joss , is supposed to be a minister of some sort , but his actual faith is left pretty vague . \\ni can\\'t even say for certain that he was supposed to be a christian . \\nall we know is that he dropped out of the seminary and obviously has no qualms about pre-marital sex . \\nthe film drops the science ball at the very end , when ellie appears to assert that there are some things even scientists must take on faith . \\nin a day and age when the theory of evolution is denounced by the religion right as an atheist \" religious \" doctrine , this is exactly the wrong message to send . \\nin a movie dealing with issues of science and faith , the last thing you want your scientist character to do is abandon the principle of scientific skepticism . \\nwhat ellie should have said was , \" you shouldn\\'t believe me . \\nnot without evidence , and i don\\'t have the evidence . \\ni know what happened but you shouldn\\'t take my word alone . \" \\nthat is the voice of science speaking . \\nthe character of david drumlin is another problem with this film . \\nhis attitudes toward pure research project seem out of place for a person in his position . \\nalso , his profession of \" faith \" before the selection committee is so nakedly and transparently insincere that only a pack of idiots should have fallen for it . \\nthe last big problem is with the use of real personalities in various roles . \\nthe media figures , such as bernard shaw and jay leno aren\\'t so bad , in as much as their participation was voluntary . \\nthe use of bill clinton , however , should give anyone pause . \\nfirst of all , lifting the image of a sitting head of state and inserting him into a fictional story line , thus using his words outside of the context in which they were spoken , is just plain creepy . \\nalso , using the real president places this film between 1993 and 2001 , forever dating it . \\npeople watching this film in the future will say , \" hey , this never took place during clinton\\'s term . \" \\nthis bit of unreality will jar people out of their suspension of disbelief . \\nalso , the level of technology portrayed in the film is too advanced to take place before the first decade of the next century . \\nbetter to have had a fictitious president played by an actor or no president at all . \\nthe film does raise an interesting question , although it never develops it in a satisfying way . \\nif we were picking an emissary to send to an alien culture , would an atheist be automatically disqualified

       " b'on june 30 , 1960 , a self-taught , idealistic , yet pragmatic , young man became , at age 36 , the first head of government of a newly independent african state , formerly the belgian congo . \\ntwo months later , he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides . \\nthis little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in \" lumumba . \" \\npatrice lumumba\\'s ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , \" lumumba - death of a prophet , \" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject . \\npeck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader . \\nwe watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men . \\nimages of hatchets , saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image . \\njump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo . \\na third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader . \\nhis small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville . \\nat a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc . \\nas the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation\\'s first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) . \\nthe coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country\\'s vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more . \\nlumumba won\\'t seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government . \\nhis initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination . \\nthe situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad . \\nthis tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries . \\npeck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50\\'s and 60\\'s . \\n ( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them . \\nsome colonial masters were better than others . ) \\nthe effort involved in \" lumumba \" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all . \\nproduction values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget . \\nthe period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique . \\nthe screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman\\'s work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba\\'s life . \\nthe political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches . \\nit concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn\\'t embellish on a larger than life persona . \\nthe family side of patrice\\'s life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child . \\ni know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba . \\nthe story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it . \\nhigh marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character . \\nthe actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions . \\nin true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead . \\n \" lumumba \" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both . \\nit has more intelligence in its telling than anything i\\'ve seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ . \\n',\n",

       " b'plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he\\'s devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place . \\ncritique : i\\'m a sucker for movies like this . \\na young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time . \\nin the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer . \\nhis entry and adaptation to the whole \" rock \\'n roll \" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch . \\nalthough i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it . \\nmetal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn\\'t that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again . \\nthat\\'s not to say that you won\\'t like this film if you don\\'t like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all . \\nbut the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg . \\nwow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film\\'s original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) . \\nhe is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through . \\nhe came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams . \\naniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn\\'t pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes . \\ni was also impressed by some of the \" real \" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members . \\nit\\'s to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) . \\njust for the record , i\\'m certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it\\'s a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances . \\noh yeah , and for those who dig the \" heavier \" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! ! \\nyou see . . . dreams \\ncan come true . . . \\nwhere\\'s joblo coming from ? \\nalmost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 ) \\n',\n",
       " b'with many big-budget science fiction films , great ideas are often wasted by bad scripts , cheesy plot twists , and , terrible acting . \\nthe fifth element , the abyss , and godzilla had great concepts squandered by bad acting , writing , or both . \\nat first glance , the matrix , larry & andy wachowski\\'s sci-fi/kung-fu/shoot-em-up spectacular , looks like a prime candidate to join the list of high-concept bad movies , especially with dopey keanu reeves in the leading role . \\nbut despite high levels of cheese and gaudy dialogue , the matrix works . \\nit\\'s an uncanny blend of action and surreal fantasy that borrows from dozens of other films ( most obviously the terminator films , star wars , and total recall ) , but remains refreshingly original and interesting throughout . \\nreeves plays neo , a computer hacker who stumbles into an initially bewildering set of encounters with \" trinity \" ( carrie-anne moss ) , a rival hacker who has supernatural powers and stunning good looks , a unseen , omniscient cult figure known as \" morpheus \" ( lawrence fishburne ) , and a trio of creepy men in dark suits who act like irs agents from hell . \\nneo quickly learns that the world he has known all his life is not what it seems . \\nmoreover , he discovers that the grim , bleak world he is introduced to has been waiting for him to save it . \\nneo is reluctant to assume the role of messiah , with grave doubts that he is actually \" the one \" prophesized to come and save the world . \\nreluctant or not , what follows is a mix of hong kong-style slow-motion shootouts , surreal dream sequences , high speed chases , and comic book kung-fu fights . \\nthe film also raises interesting philosophical questions about reality . \\nhow exactly do you know what is real and what is in your mind ? \\nand if the real world were much harsher and grim than a fantasy one you were living in , would you want to face the true world or continue to live in a more comfortable illusion ? \\nunfortunately , the matrix doesn\\'t provide many answers to the questions it raises , but at least it puts some ideas behind all the explosions , shoot-outs , and flying roundhouse kicks . \\nperhaps stealing the entire show in the matrix is australian actor hugo weaving , who plays agent smith , the leader of the creepy agents in sunglasses and suits who seem capable of being anywhere and doing anything to stop neo and friends from destabilizing the matrix . \\nweaving\\'s stony appearance , deadpan voice , and chilling comments put a grim human face on the haunting , evil technological force that controls the matrix . \\nlike robert patrick as the shapeshifting t-1000 terminator in terminator 2 : judgement day , weaving is more frightening than any monstrous alien or homicidal robot because , despite his power and seeming invincibility , he looks ordinary , even scrawny . \\nweaving embodies his role with a memorably chilling presence . \\nthe film features some truly breathtaking special effects and stylish cinematography . \\nit seems to be deliberately kitchy , with stylized fight sequences directed by hong kong stunt specialist wo ping that reportedly required months of martial arts training by the actors . \\nin a few scenes , the posing and posturing is unintentionally funny . \\njust seeing keanu reeves engaging in serious kung fu is a bit jarring . \\nhowever , with the comic-book style and tone of the film , you can sustain willing disbelief long enough to enjoy the ride without losing patience . \\nthe matrix isn\\'t a classic . \\nits open-ended and confusing conclusion raises more questions than it answers . \\nit fails to resolve many of its own plot twists and philosophical questions . \\nit also relies on some conventional sentimentality to save the hero - the kind of shmaltzy feel-good goo that most of the film avoids . \\nreportedly , the producers have high hopes for the film being the first in a trilogy and have already begun work on the story for the sequel . \\nunfortunately , audiences deserve a little more than a vague sense that the story will continue in the future . \\nthe matrix is an fun , enjoyable diversion , like a big puff of cotton candy at a carnival . \\njust don\\'t be surprised half an hour later when you still feel a little hungry . \\n',\n",

       " b\"a welcome cinematic trend over the past couple of years has been to make the works of shakespeare more accessible to the younger audiences who are the vast majority of moviegoers by contemporizing the bard and altering the settings to familiar surroundings . \\na prime example of this is 1999's 10 things i hate about you , which was basically the taming of the shrew in a high school . \\nless successful was last year's adaptation of hamlet with ethan hawke as the heir apparent of the denmark corp . here the setting was the corporate world of new york . \\nnow comes o , a faithful retelling of one of the most tragic of shakespeare's tragedies . \\nlike 10 things i hate about you , the stage is a high school - a private prep school where odin james ( mekhi phifer ) is the on-court general , the basketball team's standout player . \\njulia stiles , featured in 10 things i hate about you as well as performing ophelia in hawke's hamlet , plays desi brable , odin's girlfriend , whose father also happens to be dean of the institution . \\njosh hartnett ( pearl harbor ) is on hand for the villainy , playing the scheming hugo , who sets the tragic wheels in motion . \\no was actually filmed a couple of years ago , but was shelved because of the columbine high school tragedy . \\nthe movie , directed by tim blake nelson - best known for his co-starring role in o brother , where art thou ? \\n- and written by brad kaaya , is very grim . \\nan air of tragedy weighs it down from the opening scene to the closing credits . \\nand that is how it should be . \\nof all of shakespeare's tragedies , othello is the most harrowing , not because of any body count , but because of the psychological havoc wreaked by iago , whose motivation in the sheer pleasure of his treachery . \\nkaaya's profane-filled script - after all , these are high school kids - does offer hugo a subtle motive of sorts . \\nthe young man considers himself the basketball team's prime utility man who does a little bit of everything - pass , shoot , rebound - but is constantly in the shadow of odin . \\nplus his father , the team's coach - played with a ferocious intensity by martin sheen - showers more love and concern on his star player than on his own flesh and blood . \\nthe script follows the familiar lines of the classic . \\nhugo begins dropping hints to odin concerning desi's fidelity , eroding the star's confidence in those he considers closest to him , affecting both his relationships and his game . \\nit all ends in blood , of course , which is why the movie was originally shelved . \\nthe performances in o vary . \\nphifer is at first cocky and self-assured , emotions he handles with ease . \\nhe also does quite well displaying odin's darker side ; his defensive sensitivity about being the only black at the institution , his growing distrust of those he loved , his rage and the erosion of his belief system . \\nhartnett is appropriately cool and machiavellian as he weaves his deadly web of lies and deceit , turning friend against friend , and lover against lover . \\nstiles seems a bit stilted , but occasionally also rises to the occasion , moving from adoration to confusion to fear of her young knight . \\nthe film does contain a few missteps : a subplot involving hugo's theft of the school mascot is left hanging . \\nalso desi's actions concerning michael ( andrew keegan ) , odin's former teammate and best friend who was kicked off the team because of one of hugo's machinations , is puzzling . \\nwhy she would continually be seen with michael - however innocent the circumstances - when she knows her man suspects the two of cheating behind his back . \\nit is irrational . \\nbut these are minor carpings . \\noverall , o is a stylish and faithful adaptation . \\nif nothing else , it may encourage some people to read the original text , and that will counterbalance the severity of this feature . \\n\",\n",

flying going on in this film ! \\nas our first host steve martin tells us , the original concept behind fantasia was to bring it out every year with some old segments retained and some new segments added in . \\nwell apparently that plan fell by the wayside for a while , because approximately sixty years have passed since the original classic was released . \\npart of this might have something to do with the cold reception the film got when it was first released in 1940 ( grossing somewhere close to $110 , 000 in its original month of release ) . \\nsubsequent re-releases of the film have elevated the popularity of the film to the classic status it has finally achieved ( and rightfully deserved ) . \\nto celebrate the release of an updated version of fantasia , disney and imax teamed up to present the animated film in a fashion no one had seen before : six stories high . \\nin an exclusive four month engagement ( from january 1st to april 30th , 2000 ) , fantasia 2000 can be seen at many imax theaters across the us . \\nafter the engagement is over , the film will be shown at regular theaters . \\nis the format effective for the film ? \\nwith a few exceptions , yes . \\nthe first segment we are presented with is set to beethoven\\'s fifth symphony . \\nit\\'s hard to describe exactly what this segment is about , but it involves a bunch of brightly colored butterfly looking triangles flitting about happily . \\neverything seems to be going great for these little things until the ground erupts with swarms of evil , black bat-like triangles that attack and engulf their lighter counterparts . \\neventually , shafts of light from above help drive away the evil bat-like things and peace returns to the butterfly things . \\nthough this segment isn\\'t very story driven , some of the images are very visually strong , especially the scene in which the dark cloud of bat things ( who are all outlined in blood red colors ) begin to overtake the skies . \\nthe next segment is set to ottorino respighi\\'s \" the pines of rome \" . \\nin this segment , some humpback whales swim happily through the ocean and eventually emerge from the water and fly around the massive icebergs that pepper the oceanscape . \\na whale calf gets into a scuffle with some nearby birds during the flight and ends up getting trapped in a giant iceberg he smashes into while trying to avoid the birds attack . \\nhe is finally saved ( by another liberating shaft of light ) and he and his brethren take to the skies and fly into the upper atmosphere where they frolic in the \" oceans \" of clouds . \\nagain , visuals are the key with this segment , especially where the whales are involved . \\nreportedly the whales , as viewed on an imax screen in certain sequences , are shown as actual size . \\nthe cgi whales look incredibly life-like , except for some googly cartoon eyes drawn onto the images . \\none especially striking image involves the giant shadow of one of the whales being cast through the wall of an iceberg as the whale calf tries to find a way out to its parent . \\nabsolutely beautiful stuff . \\nthe third segment ( and the least of the eight segments ) is set to george gershwin\\'s \" rhapsody in blue \" . \\nthis segment is designed as a tribute to acclaimed caricaturist al hirschfeld , and intertwines four different stories about sad souls living in depression era new york . \\nthere\\'s a construction worker who dreams of being a jazz drummer , an out-of-work sad sack that dreams of having a job , a young girl that dreams of spending time with her parents instead of being hustled off by a schoolmarm , and a nebbish who dreams of being free from his overbearing wife . \\ni won\\'t go into how everything works out , but in fine disney tradition there is a happy ending . \\nunfortunately , the story drags quite a bit and the seems out of place within the hyper reality of the rest of the segments . \\nsegment four is set to dmitri shostakovich\\'s \" piano concerto no . 2 \" and is an animated version of hans christian andersen\\'s \" the steadfast tin soldier \" . \\na one legged toy tin soldier falls in love with a wind-up clock ballerina ( whom he assumes is also one legged because he can\\'t see her other leg extended out behind her ) , much to the dismay of an evil jack-in-the-box jester . \\nthe jester knocks the soldier out of a window and continues pursuing the ballerina . \\nlittle does the jester know , the soldier has been deposited in the sewer and has journeyed through the pipelines only to be swallowed by a fish that has been captured and sold to the owner of the set of tin soldiers that the one legged one comes from . \\nthe soldier eventually saves the day and gets the girl . \\nalthough the ending has been altered from the andersen story , \" the steadfast tin soldier \" is decently told with in the framework of a seven minute short . \\nsome children may find the jester to be a little frightening , but otherwise the segment is well made . \\nsegment five is the funniest of the bunch . \\nset to camille saint-saens \" the carnival of the animals \" , this segment features a flamingo torturing his fellow flamingos with a yo-yo while they are trying to perform a choreographed dance number . \\nwhile it is the shortest clip of the group and a throwback to the alligators and hippos dancing in the first fantasia , it is still well accomplished and a welcome bit of comedy . \\nsegment six is the only segment to be repeated from the original 1940 fantasia , and it\\'s the one that people remember most , \" the sorcerer\\'s apprentice \" . \\nthe story is the most recognizable , so the draw here is seeing it on the enormous imax screen in remastered stereo . \\nunfortunately , the segment wasn\\'t made to be presented on large format film ( considering it was shot full frame ) and exhibits large amounts of grain . \\nthere were at least two occasions where images were very hard to make out due to the excessive grain . \\nsimilar problems crop up on modern day releases when projected on screens too large for the image to be shown accurately ( but no one seems to notice for some strange reason ) , an anomaly common to many 18-plus screen theaters . \\nsegment seven is set to sir edward elgar\\'s \" pomp and circumstance march no . 1 \" and is the only other fantasia segment to feature a stock disney character . \\ndonald duck \" stars \" as an assistant to noah , whose task is loading all of the animals onto the ark . \\nduring the loading , donald and his wife lose sight of each other and both believe that the other one didn\\'t make it on the boat . \\nthey are constantly missing each other due to comic misadventures mainly involving donald being crushed by animals in various manners . \\ndespite the slapstick style of comedy in this piece , it displays more emotion in its final scene than many of the tear-jerkers foisted on audiences these days . \\npowerful stuff . \\nsegment eight brings a whole new meaning to the clich ? \" saving the best for last \" . \\nset to igor stravinsky\\'s \" the

their gags seem routine and therefore uninteresting . \\nthe best segment comes from , of all people , bette midler , who gets to tell us about some of the abandoned segments that never made it off of the drawing board . \\npieces like flight of the bumblebee , a take on the four horsemen set to wagner\\'s \" ride of the valkyries \" , and a strange segment prepared in the \\'40s by salvador dali

( \" cast away \" ) , and lawrence konner & mark d . rosenthal ( \" mighty joe young \" ) . \\ndirector tim burton\\'s unique look and style are nowhere to be found in this silly , pointless remake . \\ndavidson no sooner lands than he finds himself being swarmed by savages running in terror , whom he wisely joins . \\nhowever , he\\'s rounded up with the lot of them by the apes which rule this plant and handed over to slave trader limbo ( paul giamatti , \" duets \" ) . \\nari ( helena bonham carter , \" fight club \" ) , daughter of the illustrious senator sandar ( david warner , \" titanic \" ) and simian bleeding heart , believes humans should live with apes on equal standing , an unpopular notion . \\nshe takes a liking to leo , who she deems \\'unusual . \\' \\ngeneral thade ( tim roth , \" lucky numbers \" ) is of the opposite opinion , wishing for declaration of martial law that will allow him to annihilate the race . \\nhe\\'s sweet on ari . \\nit\\'s relatively easy to see where this \\'new\\' story is going from the onset , yet its ultimate revelation has gaping logic holes . \\nthe much ballyhooed \\'surprise\\' ending is a nonsensical let down . \\nan attempt at a love triangle , conveyed by ari and the human daena ( estella warren , \" driven \" ) giving each other \\'back off\\' looks over leo , fails because he never develops a relationship with either of them . \\nthe lone sex scene is some hilarious foreplay between elder orangutan senator nado ( glenn shadix ) and his trophy wife nova ( burton\\'s squeeze , lisa marie ) . \\nguffaws will also likely greet charlton heston\\'s cameo as thade\\'s father , the one ape harboring a firearm ( ! ) who sputters some very familiar lines before dying . \\nthe only real success of the 2001 \" planet of the apes \" is rick baker\\'s makeup , and even that\\'s an iffy affair . \\nno attempt was made to change the human whiteness of the actors\\' eyes , a real distraction amidst some otherwise impressive work . \\nroth , warner and michael clarke duncan ( as thade\\'s right hand man attar ) are given the most impressive makeovers . \\ngiamatti looks more like a skull than an ape and the female apes are too humanized to be given sexual appeal . \\ntim roth delivers the most impressive acting job by getting the body language right - his nasty chimpanzee character leaps about , most spectacularly when mounting his steed , but even\\'s he\\'s undone by some obvious wire work . \\nbonham carter delivers a goodly range of emotion from behind a stiff prosthetic , but is undone in turn by the silliness of the writing . \\nmost of the film has a set bound look which no amount of mist can cover . \\nthe ape\\'s city resembles a dank complex of tree houses . \\nthe apes\\' military costumes ( colleen atwood , \" sleepy hollow \" ) as well as their field tents are reminiscent of eiko ishioka\\'s work on coppola\\'s \" dracula . \" \\nthat oriental flavor is also found in danny elfman\\'s tribal , percussive score . \\n \" planet of the apes \" was the last blockbuster hope for the summer of 2001 , a dismal movie season that\\'s going to the dogs . \\n',\n",
       " b'as much as i wanted to like this film as i went into it , the more pleased i was when i left . \\nfirst , getting through all the usual lines of newspaper glitz : \" if you liked scream , you\\'ll love wild things ! \" \\n \" campbell gives a stunning performance ! \" \\n \" this twisty plot will have you dazzled for days ! \" \\n ( oh yeah , the day a newspaper uses these is the day neve campbell falls in love with me ) \\nnow , onto more serious stuff ( and with this film , i mean that in nearly a sarcastic way ) . \\nwild things has single-handedly broken down the rules surrounding the r rating from the mpaa . \\ni\\'m not saying that in a bad way , but when you see this film , you may be shocked by what you see . \\nhowever , perhaps the mpaa was pleased by the film\\'s charming cast and tricky plot , that they let the film slide with an r rating . \\nbeing mormon , i\\'m bound to hear an uproar from religious zealots warning me not to see the film . \\ntrouble is , i have already seen it . \\nand i like it ! \\nwild things is a film noir of the 90s , filled with 40s sensibilities , and yet breaking the rules and modern-day taboos of 90s culture . \\nthe style in which it is filmed is rich in color . \\nthe actors are all gorgeous people , seemingly drawn from the same gene pool and placed into this film . \\nsure , it\\'s all too good to be true , but ain\\'t it fun to watch ? \\nwhen movies like this come along ( sort of a better version of basic instinct ) there is bound to be people who either love it or hate it . \\nthere will be people who don\\'t want to admit liking what they see , but i tell you , most anyone who sees this will like it . \\nwild things begins at blue bay high school , the one high school in the world that any teenager would love to get into . \\nit\\'s almost as if students are put through entrance exams just for admittance ( totally based on looks alone ) . \\nof course , there are those select few who may look slightly ugly , but compared to the average person , they are gorgeous . \\nimmediately , the film finds its tone and the audience settles in for an enjoyable time . \\nwe can turn off our brains , right ? \\nwrong . \\nwhile you may be expecting one thing to happen , it certainly doesn\\'t turn out that way . \\nthe film begins in a classroom , with nearly all the main characters present . \\nthere\\'s sam lombardo ( matt dillon ) , a counselor for the students . \\nhe\\'s heading the class discussion . \\nthere\\'s also kelly van ryan ( denise richards ) , a snobby rich teen who has fallen in love with sam . \\nteaching the class , however , are two policemen : ray duquette ( kevin bacon ) and gloria perez ( daphne rubin-vega ) , who want to talk about \\'sex . . . \\n ( cheers ) crimes ( boos ) \\' . \\n \" what is a sex crime ? \" \\nray asks . \\n \" not gettin\\' any ! \" \\none student responds . \\nthis pretty much sets the tone of the film we are about to watch . \\nhowever , upon hearing this , one student , suzie toller ( neve campbell ) , stands up and leaves the room , commenting that they can both kiss part of her body . \\nand so , wild things sets into motion . \\nquickly , kelly begins hitting on sam , but sam doesn\\'t want anything to do with her advances . \\nkelly is stubborn and continues to pursue him . \\nshe even pleads with him to let her wash his jeep . \\nsurprisingly , that\\'s really all i can tell you about the plot . \\nany more would give away one of the many crucial plot twists . \\nand what\\'s more , these plot twists are actually unpredictable . \\ngoing along the way of scream , wild things maintains that film\\'s surprises , and then adds even more to them . \\nthere are more plot twists in this film than probably any i have ever seen . \\nand even though you think you may get tired of them , the surprises are so genuine that it\\'s rather pleasing . \\ngoing back over them in my mind , nearly all of them work , though some stretch the boundaries of belief . \\nthankfully , the convoluted plot doesn\\'t give us much time to think about each one , pouncing yet another twist on us before the shock of the previous one has worn off . \\nas for the critics who complain that the film is trashy--well , it is . \\nthis is pretty much just one trashy film . \\nhowever , it is the kind of trashy that isn\\'t hard to watch . \\nit\\'s good trash , in a sense . \\none , the screenplay knows that it\\'s not to be taken seriously , and it includes a lot of humor and satire into the story . \\nthis varies everywhere from kelly\\'s mother ( theresa russell ) , who is more of a caricature of rich people , all the way to an ambulance-chasing lawyer ( bill murray ) , who wears a neck-brace to cover an insurance scam he is running . \\nbill murray also provides the best character in the film , and most of the genuine laughs . \\nand two , the sex is more than gratuitous , although not unwelcomed . \\nwild things is supposed to have sex in it ( what film with that title wouldn\\'t ? ) , and this movie breaks the boundaries . \\ninstead of having heterosexual sex scenes , it also includes lesbian scenes between denise richards and neve campbell ( don\\'t worry . . . \\nit\\'s not as graphic as you might think ) . \\nthe heterosexual scenes are quite graphic , but the surprise shocker is kevin bacon\\'s full-frontal nude scene . \\nit\\'s very brief , so if you blink , you may miss ( ahem ) it . \\nand , for as long as i can remember , i don\\'t think i have seen an r-rated film show an erect one before ( it\\'s not completely , but judging from the audiences\\' reaction , it was more than they expected too ) . \\nalso , during one scene late in the film , there seemed to be a relationship brewing between bacon and dillon\\'s characters , but nothing came of it ( makes you wonder if the director had to cut it in order for the r rating , or if the actors refused to do it ) . \\nwhat first made me want to see wild things was its cast . \\nneve campbell , of course , has been one of my favorite actresses since the scream films were released . \\nhere , however , she turns every typical role she has done on its head and plays a gothic pothead . \\nthe closest role to this was her performance in the craft ( though even in that she was a nice girl ) . \\ncampbell is probably the best in the film and shows her wide range of talent . \\nyou can tell she will be around for a long time . \\ndenise richards will also be around for a long time , although she may be limited to the roles without much range . \\nhere , she gets to express more emotions than in her stiff ( yet effective ) performance in starship troopers . \\nhopefully one day she will land a very good role that can display her ability . \\nand then there is daphne rubin-vega , a newcomer to the movies . \\nshe gives a very good performance , although her character is mostly left to the background for the first hour and a half . \\ntowards the end she does get a bigger part . \\non the male side , matt dillon is probably the best , giving a subtle performance that surprises with every twist . \\nkevin bacon has a slightly wooden character , but he makes the most of it . \\nyou must have admiration , though , for what he did on screen . \\nand judging from many of the women\\'s reactions in the theater to that shot , they have grown a deeper appreciation for bacon ( yeah , right ) . \\nand then there is bill murray . \\nhis performance is the comic relief , and he nearly steals the film . \\nas a whole , the entire cast works wondrously together , and they seem at home , even when doing the menage a troi . \\ndirector john mcnaughton , who has previously done the critically acclaimed henry : portrait of a serial killer , has constructed a wonderfully twisty plot that works . \\nhis direction is smooth and stylish . \\nthe visuals are striking , filled with rich colors , and almost so realistic that we can actually breathe the humidity in the air . \\nhowever , he seems more at home when the actors aren\\'t talking . \\nhis fly-by shots of the swampy areas are brilliant , and his photography of denise richards\\' climbing out of the pool is a highlight . \\nthe cinematography is gorgeous in its details . its not often that you see a film like this , and we should watch it just to see how the camera can take pictures . \\nthen , there is the music . \\nthis was probably the most obvious thing to me , as it set the perfect mood for the film . \\nit\\'s hard to describe in words , so just see the film and listen to it . \\nit\\'s wonderfully composed and presented . \\nand be sure to stick around during the closing credits ! \\nmcnaughton has finally put the ending credits to good use ( while most comedies use it for outtakes ) . \\nhe has included some small scenes which help explain the preceding events . \\nsome may say that these are lame attempts to explain the convoluted plot , but it\\'s an entertaining way to finish the film . \\nplus , there are some shocking moments in these ending credits which just add to the fun . \\nwild things is appropriately rated r for strong sexuality , nudity , language and violence . \\nagain , the nudity is rather unnecessary , but let\\'s face it--people want to see it . \\nso why not give it to them ? \\nneve campbell , admirably , has a no-nudity clause in her contract , and the most you see of her is from behind as she takes her top off ( way to go , neve ! ) . \\nthe sex scenes are graphic , especially the first one we see , between the mother and one of her deck hands . \\none almost wonders how they got away with the r rating . \\nthe language is quite harsh too , ranging from sexual innuendo to your average , everyday profanity . \\nand i can\\'t stress it enough : don\\'t allow kids under 18 to see this film . \\nthe target age for the movie is the 18-24 range , and that\\'s who should see it . \\nit\\'s definitely not for those under 18 ! \\ndid i mention that this film is rated r ? however , for those that do get a chance to watch it , you will probably more likely be pleased , and may even take friends to see it the next time . \\n',\n",

' \\nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film's plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \\nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \\nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \\nwe know obi-wan `ben' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . ' \\nwe also know something about `the force' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \\nwhat we don't know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \\nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \\nalso , it seems that we're supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \\nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire' and `jedi , ' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \\nfor those who haven't kept up with all the `star wars' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \\nwith `the phantom menace' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force' and the jedi knights . \\nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \\ni didn't liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \\nif you're going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \\nbut i digress . \\ni've said so much and yet i haven't even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \\nall these necessary `disclaiming' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars' series is and this individual film itself . \\nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we've come to know and love since the late 1970s . \\nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \\nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \\nwe're told that an army known as `the trade federation' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \\nwe're not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \\nwe're introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \\nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet's queen , amidala ( portman ) . \\nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \\nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \\nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \\nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \\ni have a feeling we'll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \\nbut it doesn't take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film's story begins to move along . \\nthe film doesn't have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \\nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \\nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films' screenplays were also limiting . \\nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace' its unique traits . \\nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \\nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \\nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala's spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \\ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \\njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \\nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \\nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \\nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \\nby the film's third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \\nit's funny how the reality of the `star wars' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \\nnot that this technique hasn't been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \\nand at least it's all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \\nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that's just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \\n`the phantom menace' delivers exactly what you'd expect from a `star wars' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \\nso many things in the film we've seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \\nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \\n\",\n",

       " b'you\\'ve got to think twice before you go see a movie with a title like maximum risk . \\nthe title is generic . \\nit\\'s meaningless . \\nand i can\\'t believe it\\'s good business . \\nwhen you pick up the phone and dial 777-film , how in the world are you supposed to remember that the new jean-claude van damme movie , the one that looked kind of cool in the trailers and is directed by some chinese hot shot , is called , geez , maximum risk ? \\nyuck . \\nthe movie itself deserves your attention . \\nfor sweet bloody thrills , this one beats the summer blockbuster competition hands-down . \\nonly mission : impossible came close to delivering as skillful a thriller , and i\\'ll give maximum risk the edge simply because it\\'s not as slick as the tom cruise picture , and therefore more gratifying in its execution . \\nmuch to my surprise , van damme continues to develop as a pleasant , unpretentious action hero . \\nhis track record isn\\'t as solid as schwarzenegger\\'s , but he\\'s a hell of a lot more adventurous than arnold . \\nin 1993 , van damme worked with hong kong\\'s premier hardcore action director , john woo , on a fairly lame movie called hard target . \\n ( if you can find a bootleg copy , woo\\'s radically different director\\'s cut is much better than what was eventually released . ) \\nthis follow-up is directed by ringo lam ( city on fire , full contact ) , whose hong kong films are distinguished action pictures that have consistently played second fiddle to woo\\'s more operatic offerings . \\nthe surprise here is that maximum risk is a more effective hollywood action flick than either hard target or woo\\'s subsequent broken arrow . \\nhere\\'s the rundown . \\nvan damme plays a french cop named alain moreau who is shaken when a policeman friend ( jean-hugues anglade ) finds a corpse that\\'s alain\\'s exact double . \\nturns out alain was separated at birth from his twin brother , michael , who has been killed by some russian heavies ( and some strangely american looking cops ) . \\nalain does some investigating . \\nhe finds that michael had booked a flight to new york city , and received a message from someone there named alex bohemia . \\nassuming michael\\'s identity , alain flies to new york and gets tangled up with michael\\'s girlfriend ( natasha henstridge ) , the fbi , and the russian mob in little odessa . \\nthat\\'s as much as you need to know . \\nthe story is adequate , but not overly involving -- and the major plot points are basically explained to you twice , just in case you go out for popcorn at the wrong moment . \\nthere\\'s a love story , too , but i didn\\'t find it terribly convincing , partly because ex-model henstridge is too high-strung in her high-profile debut ( she had precious few lines as the alien ice queen in species ) . \\nshe\\'s great to look at , and she can certainly read a line , but what she does here can\\'t really be described as \" acting . \" \\nof course , \" acting \" isn\\'t really what she was hired for ( i lost track of whether her shirt comes off more often than van damme\\'s ) . \\nthe movie is exceptionally violent , bordering on gratuity . \\n ( keep that in mind when planning your date . ) \\nthe stunts are spectacular , and the fact that you can spot van damme\\'s stand-in makes his work no less impressive . \\nthere\\'s only so much you can do with a car wreck , but this movie makes crisp , effective use of pile-ups in a handful of frenzied destruction derbies . \\nand lam has a surprising , innovative sense of exactly where the camera should go to catch any bit of action . \\nthe main difference between lam and woo , i believe , is that while woo relies on sheer spectacle to gas up his action show pieces , lam has figured out more about using cinematic space and double-barreled points of view to make things run . \\ndon\\'t get me wrong -- when chow yun-fat soars through space pumping bullets out of two pistols and chewing on a toothpick with glass and confetti littering the air around him in woo\\'s hard-boiled , it\\'s an amazing moment . \\nbut it\\'s a moment that\\'s hard to reproduce in hollywood . \\n ( for one thing , hollywood doesn\\'t yet have chow yun-fat ! ) \\nwhile woo\\'s hollywood movies look like the work of a talented upstart , maximum risk is a surprisingly confident picture . \\nthe very first shot of the film is an awkward overhead view of a chase through the streets of a european city , but lam\\'s use of odd camera angles becomes more efficient later on . \\nthe film editing is a particularly savvy complement to lam\\'s shooting style , accentuating rather than amplifying the action . \\nthe performances could have used some fine tuning ( in particular , there\\'s an annoying , overwritten manhattan cab driver in the early scenes who should have been toned down or jettisoned completely ) , and the movie doesn\\'t always overcome the limitations of its genre . \\nthe story is a little mundane , although there are some effective moments involving van damme\\'s unrequited feelings toward the brother he never knew he had . \\nbut it\\'s not often that hollywood cranks out a truly satisfying action picture , and it\\'s doubly surprising that this one should come with a mere whisper of publicity . \\nvan damme fans should treat themselves to what may well be the man\\'s best movie , and international action buffs will no doubt savor this flavorful hong kong/hollywood hybrid . \\n',\n",

       " b\"retelling the classic story of joan of arc has been a popular trend this year . \\nearlier this may , leelee sobieski played the passionate title role in the top-rated miniseries that debuted on cbs . \\nand now , director luc besson has delivered his version of the sweeping epic about the teenage girl supposedly sent by god to rescue france from the clutches of their enemies . \\nstarring milla jovovich , who is predominantly unconvincing as the heavenly messenger accused of being a witch , `the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is a disjointed and overblown historical re-enactment that prevails merely as a bloated mistreatment of the famous legend . \\nbesson ( who's previous work includes the hyperactive sci-fi `the fifth element' ) perhaps entrusted a bit too much faith in ex-wife jovovich , because in `the messenger' , the actress is drowning in a pool of her own inexperience . \\nat first , when reports were indicating that jovovich had been chosen for such a demanding role , i was highly doubtful that her marginal talent could carry a film of such a caliber . \\nafter seeing the rousing trailer , my hesitant optimism suddenly skyrocketed - milla jovovich looked superb . \\nwith the hopeful propulsion of her stellar performance , `the messenger' looked like a timeless epic in the making . \\na timeless epic it is not . \\nbesson is hesitant to abandon his unique and flashy style , and the story behind `the messenger' is not entirely suited to his demands . \\non the shoulders of besson's choppy and unexciting direction , the film dissipates into an uninspiring hodgepodge of poorly executed battle sequences and bizarre imagery . \\nthere is no human exploration into the character of joan ( or jeanne ) . \\njovovich merely rambles on about the power of god when we have little or no insight into her visionary objective . \\njovivich's unsatisfying portrayal only helps lead to the realization that besson sees jeanne as a piece of spiritual cardboard . \\nshe is just another special effect in this continuous visual feast . \\njovovich does have a few isolated moments of sheer power , but mainly , she looks lost . \\nquite frankly , i don't know of any actress who could successfully navigate her way through `the messenger' without a major fumble . \\nthe script is chock-full of laughable dialogue and unfortunate comedy , as jeanne confronts the uncrowned king charles vii ( john malkovich ) and informs him of her heavenly intentions . \\nfaye dunaway plays charles' overbearing mother-in-law , and dustin hoffman appears over two-hours into the story as a character dubbed ? the conscience' . \\nall three actors juggle limited screen time , although malkovich is uncharacteristically awful . \\nthe battle scenes are extremely bloody , but with the presence of such jittery camera work , they capture none of the excitement or finesse of something like `braveheart' . \\nthere's a particularly graphic and unsettling scene early on , when jeanne ( as a young girl ) watches in horror from a closet as her older sister is murdered and then savagely raped by a bloodthirsty english soldier . \\neven his fellow troopers are petrified . \\n`the messenger' is also strictly a 90's update on the classic story . \\nalmost too 90's , it seems . \\nthere's gratuitous use of the f-word and a barrage of slang terms like `she's nuts ! ' \\nsprinkled throughout the screenplay . \\ni was half-expecting jeanne to invite her homeys to come chill in her crib , but it never happened . \\nthere's also the familiar presence of bizarre besson humor , but none of it comes even remotely close to functioning properly . \\nit seems terribly misplaced , but in a catastrophe as jumbled and disjointed as `the messenger' , almost everything does . \\nthe musical score by erric serra is spectacular , and the set and production designs are continuously impressive . \\nif it was visual excellence that besson was striving for , then he achieves his goal . \\nbut the only time the dramatics come alive in `the messenger' is during the closing trial , in which jeanne is found guilty and burned at the stake . \\nduring these moments , the historical relevance and dramatic purpose of joan of arc reaches the audience , albeit in a faint stream of light that provokes little power or meaning . \\nit's just too delayed for besson to revive his lifeless interpretation , in which he is always concerned with the wrong aspects . \\n`the messenger : the story of joan of arc' is an unlikely and unwelcome historical addition to the hollywood shelf . \\nanyone searching for an entertaining epic is going to be painfully slapped with an overblown and confusing film . \\ndespite my original hopefulness , milla jovovich is not going to have to worry about thanking the academy . \\n\",\n",
       " b\"just look back two years ago at the coen brothers' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you've got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby's novel high fidelity came first ) . \\neither way , it's been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \\nwhy is this ? \\nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they're fictional . \\ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \\nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else's pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \\ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can't put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \\ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \\nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \\nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \\nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \\nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \\nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \\nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \\ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \\nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \\nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \\nbut these aren't any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob's incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \\nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \\nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \\nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob's own lifestyle . \\nit also helps open the viewer's eyes as to how annoying barry is . \\njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \\njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \\nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \\njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \\nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \\nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn't end when it should have ended . \\ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \\nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \\nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \\ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \\n\",\n",

       " b'one of my brother\\'s favorite movies is h . b . halicki\\'s 1974 cult flick \" gone is sixty seconds , \" one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970\\'s . \\nchase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue , but they had a strong visceral appeal . \\nalthough it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars , the remake of \" gone in sixty seconds \" is relatively weak and dull . \\nrandall \" memphis \" raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track . \\nhe got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars . \\nhowever , kip became a thief anyway , and now he\\'s in big trouble . \\nkip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week . \\ncalitri expects memphis to fulfill kip\\'s bargain ; if he doesn\\'t come through , kip dies . \\nmemphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie , robert duvall , will patton , chi mcbride , and vinnie jones ) , and kip brings his boys ( t . j . \\ncross , william lee scott , scott caan , and james duval ) . \\nas if calitri breathing down their necks wasn\\'t bad enough , the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) who\\'s still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitri\\'s clients . \\nwatching \" gone , \" i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one . \\nmaybe that\\'s why the first forty-nine are fairly easy , and the thrills are saved for \" eleanor , \" a 1967 shelby gto , a model that has always eluded memphis . \\nbut the big chase doesn\\'t live up to the long wait . \\ni had high hopes for \" gone \" because it is director dominic sena\\'s second film . \\n \" kalifornia , \" his 1993 debut , was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience . \\nin that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance . \\nin \" gone \" he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who can\\'t communicate with each other , but that goal just doesn\\'t mesh with this plot . \\n \" gone \" either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough . \\nit\\'s not light enough to be fun , or mean enough to be intense . \\nthis chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it . \\nthe lack of action is a waste of the premise , which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever . \\nthe weak script is a waste of a talented cast . \\nin a \" newsweek \" interview last year , sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies . \\nmuch as i like cage , for every good picture he does ( \" leaving las vegas , \" \" bringing out the dead \" ) , there are two major stinkers ( \" snake eyes , \" \" con air , \" \" 8mm , \" \" city of angels \" ) . \\nthat ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast , but cage has real talent . \\nit\\'s a shame to waste it in glitzy , superficial tripe like \" gone in 60 seconds . \" \\n',\n",
       " b'it shows that america remains ambivalent over the nature of its political system . \\nno major surprise , when j . s . mill in his victorian classic on liberty could not make up his mind over liberal democracy either . \\nthe americans are wrought by the archetypal paradox under which they exist , the supreme contradiction between the right of the one and the right of the majority . \\nsmall wonder that hollywood\\'s most compelling movies have oft been on the struggle of the individual-underdog against some larger collective oppressive - witness braveheart , born on the fourth of july , rocky , first blood , clear and present danger , jfk , the list goes on . \\nthere\\'s little of that in singapore - we are barred access to playboy and penthouse both on and off line , though the government\\'s been long worried about the younger people getting \" americanised \" and advocating individual rights and parliamentary opposition . \\nthe people vs . larry flynt locates the political debate within the greatest social taboo in america - sex . \\ndoes pornography have a right to exist and circulate ? \\nlarry flynt , the publisher of hustler magazine , thinks so , and obviously so too the u . s . congress which last month threw out a bill to curb pornography on the net . \\nbut even with such actions , americans remain undecided . \\nthe oscars apparently shunned the movie because it was an embarrassing and sensitive livewire . \\nwhat they have ignored is actually a great picture . \\nwoody harrelson as the lead character reprises his role as a to-hell-with-morality , to-hell-with-the-law , and to-hell-with-the-system anti-christ that we last saw in natural born killers . \\nand he is outrageous and convincing as a nihilistic atheist who nonetheless loves his ex-stripper wife dearly . \\nthe latter is played with abandon , conviction and sensitivity all at once by courtney love , who is the real star of the show and really snubbed of an academy award best actress nomination , if not of the award itself . \\nedward norton plays their jerky lawyer . \\nthe relationship between harrelson and love brings out another great paradox - superficially they are immoral outcasts who\\'ve had it coming ; woody gets shot and becomes paralysed from the waist down , and courtney dies of aids . \\ngod\\'s damnation . \\nbut in the powerful love they have for each other , each standing by the other in turn , the two leads highlight the question how much is the nihilist still a moralist and ( in the american context ) a christian , if they can love and care , and feel just like anyone else on a personal level . \\nfriedrich nietzsche once talked about how the atheist must uncover for himself the full consequences of atheism by ridding himself of all moral-christian influences . \\nto go beyond good and evil . \\nthis is a great picture , no doubt , and i love it personally . \\nbecause it is moving , funny , ends with open american optimism blah blah . \\nbut i like it and admire it because it comes from a fine american tradition that dares to raise difficult questions , and call into doubt ideas and doctrines that otherwise are used as catchphrases . \\nthere are times when movies go beyond the story they tell and reflect something of hidden realities . \\nthis movie is not so much about larry flynt , but about americans and american society . \\n',\n",
       " b\"note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \\nbe forewarned . \\nto assess alex cox's film the winner as a loser would be so indolent . \\nit would be derisive . \\nit would be glib . \\nit would be dismissive . \\nit would be entirely accurate . \\nrarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner , a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious , unfunny , and unengaging . \\nthe film attempts to be fresh and quirky , utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale , but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous . \\nthe film is set in las vegas , and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent d'onofrio ) , an aloof , naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables . \\ndespite this prodigious talent , philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes , neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities . \\nconsequently , he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent . \\nlouise ( rebecca demornay ) , a sultry lounge singer , insinuates herself into philip's life for the purpose of swindling him , while philip's estranged brother ( and , conveniently , louise's ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene . \\n ( to add some colour , johnny also happens to be toting their father's corpse , sans one hand . ) \\nmeanwhile , philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent , opportunists ( frank whaley , billy bob thornton , and richard edson ) , who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddy's gift with the dice . \\nserenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorsese's casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casino's operations - he * is * the eye in the sky . \\nit could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation , but fortunately this is not the case in the winner , if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling , it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate , and the would-be swindlers of philip's fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous , transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest . \\nit is a shame , as the winner features a talented cast - mr . d'onofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen , ms . demornay , and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past . \\nnone of the actors in the winner are in top form here , and this film won't likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes . \\ndirector alex cox does what he can with wendy riss' screenplay , and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one . \\nwhile tedious , the film is well-paced and does not meander , but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or , for that matter , virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the film's widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization . \\nto his credit , my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies . \\ni caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996 , and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened . \\nto be honest , though , i couldn't begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question . \\nthe winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing . \\nthe film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain , but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching . \\n\",\n",
       " b'i\\'m an avid fan of the \" alien \" saga , so this review is obviously a tad biased ( at least i admitted it ) . \\nof course , that doesn\\'t mean that i\\'m gonna be giving this a four-star review or something , because \" alien : resurrection , \" the fourth film in the cool-as-hell series is not an absolutely amazing film , much like the first two were . \\nhowever , it\\'s a very good film which never fails to entertain , and consists of yet another mutation in the style of the series . \\nin short , i had a good time . \\n \" alien : resurrection \" leaves off 200 years after the last one , where our heroine protagonist , ellen ripley ( sigourney weaver ) , the science fiction genre\\'s answer to job , had killed herself after discovering that an alien was inside her body , waiting to pop out like it did to john hurt in the first one . \\nof course , the last one wasn\\'t very great or anything ( i liked it , though not as much as the first two ) , and more importantly , it wasn\\'t financially successful ( a tawdry 55 million bucks ! ) . \\nso back we are , with ripley back as a clone , which means we get another little satirical look at cloning ( not that that\\'s a bad thing , but it\\'s becoming a cliche ) . \\nso she\\'s cloned aboard an even more futuristic-looking ship called \" the auriga \" by some doctors ( including the necessary bad government guy , dr . wren , played by j . e . freeman , as well as the little-seen dr . gediman , played by none other than brad douriff ) , mainly because they have a version of her with the alien still inside her . \\nonce you get past the fact that you can\\'t figure out where they got her blood ( although i think it might have been from the blood samples taken by charles dance in the third one ) , the film\\'s okay . \\nalso on board are a band of mercenary pirates , including michael wincott , ron perlman , kim flowers , raymond cruz , dominique pinon ( a jeunet sytable ) and . . . winona ryder , who plays analee call , who turns out to have a bit of a secret ( i won\\'t state it , but unless you\\'ve been shacking up with salinger for the past two years , you probably know all about it - although it\\'s nicely covered up ) . \\nthere\\'s a bit of a non-sexual-yet-slightly-homoerotic relationship between her and ripley , but it\\'s never really deepened enough . \\noh well . \\nwell , as you might have guessed , the alien and its spawn escape and run around the ship . \\nand it pretty much does away with most of the people on the ship ( including some shocks - dan hedaya , for instance , who\\'s death is comical yet sad since , well , he\\'s dan hedaya ) , and the remaining people ( about 7 or 8 ) are left to try and escape and stop the aliens from doing any major harm since the ship is heading quickly towards earth . \\nof course , the plot is all balderdash , and just an excuse for some good old \" alien \" -brand fun . \\nthe real focus of the series seems to be on style , not really substance ( although there\\'s always a bit of it , most notably in \" aliens \" with the relationship between ripley and the little girl ) . \\nwhat\\'s interesting about the series is that each film is stylistically different in its approach . \\n \" alien \" is a claustrophobic exercise in quiet frights . \\n \" aliens \" is a wild , tense thriller . \\n \" alien 3 \" is a bleak , moody piece of semi-noir . \\n \" alien 4 \" is kind of like an off-beat french film , filled with lots of humor , and cool scares . \\njean-pierre jeunet ( without his usual directing partner , marc caro ) creates a ship filled with the kind of scares films like \" das boot \" has , with echoes hinting at a possible threat . \\nthe chills in the film are really cool , especially with the music , which is sometimes turned down completely for certain scenes ( there\\'s the most tense surgery scene since \" face/off \" towards the beginning ) . \\nand not every chill turns into a bloody mess or anything like that . \\nthis all combined with some good old humor makes this as interesting visually and stylistically as the others . \\nthere are even a couple scenes which just stick out afterwards as being brilliantly executed . \\none is the aforementioned surgery scene . \\nanother one takes place between call and ripley , which is just awesome . \\nthe underwater chase scene and the ladder scene afterwards is one of the most tense , thrilling , and jaw-dropping scenes in the entire saga ( with a small allusion to jeunet\\'s earlier film , \" delicatessen \" ) . \\nand the way they do in the final alien is hysterically cool ( with a lovely allusion to \" goldfinger \" ) . \\nbut the best scene in the entire film ( i\\'m sure i\\'m not the first to mention it ) takes place when ripley sees all the variations on her as they cloned her ( she has a an \" 8 \" tatooed on her arm ) . \\nit might be the most emotionally stimulating scene in the entire saga . \\nthe screenplay by joss whedon is not a great piece of work , as it never really deapens a lot of the characters . \\nhowever , it does make us care about most of them , so that when there\\'s very little of them , and it looks like one or more of them may become alien chow , we are pretty scared . \\nand , yeah , there are some very funny lines ( ripley : \" who do i have to fuck to get off this boat ? ! \" \\njohner : \" well , i can get you off . \\nbut not this ship . \" ) \\nthe acting is good all around , with stand-out performances from ron perlman as the male chauvenist pig johner , and leland orser ( the poor bastad in \" se7en \" who performed the \" lust \" sin ) as an anxiety-ridden wannabe woody allen who has an alien inside him . \\nwinona ryder is good , but not amazing like she usually is ( although she meshes well with the film ) . \\nof course , and as usual , sigourney weaver steals the show . \\nplaying a variation on the ripley character ( less emotional , and more rude and bitter ) , she pulls it off while still being utterly lovable . \\nshe\\'s not going to get an oscar nomination like she did for \" aliens , \" but she\\'s just awesome . \\noverall , it\\'s a thrilling , entertaining film which doesn\\'t really amaze like the first two , but is much more amazing than the third installment . \\nthe style is the best part of the film , which isn\\'t really a bad thing , but it being the best part takes away from a lot of the depth the film occasionally tries to apply . \\nbut it\\'s entertaining as hell , and it\\'s definitely fit for the \" alien \" series . \\n',\n",

' ) \\nthe audience was in stitches . \\nthere are many good things about this sequel . \\ndr . evil is now assisted by mini-me ( verne troyer ) , a pint-sized clone who is the result of an experiment gone awry . \\nmini-me is the most perfect new character that any fan could ask for , and troyer does a terrific job of mimicking everything that his big brother does , pinkie and all . \\nmindy sterling returns as frau farbissina , evil's loud-mouth assassin sidekick , and here we are treated to a brief romantic liaison between the two in an underground bedroom chamber . \\nthis works surprisingly well . \\nafterward , there's even a meeting at the coffee machine , where their awkwardness is expressed in a scene you would expect in any normal office environment . \\noh , yes . . . \\nthe plot . \\nafter a short honeymoon with vanessa kensington ( elizabeth hurley ) that goes disastrously wrong , powers is back on the case to thwart the diabolical plans of dr . evil . \\nin the original , the subject of the day was cryogenic freezing that enabled the characters to hop between two time periods . \\nhere , it's time travel . \\ndr . evil has this crazy plan to steal austin's mojo ( the source of his sexual powers ) , so he jumps through a time portal back into 1969 when powers is still is his freezing chamber . \\nthere , he employs a grotesque 600-pound scottish assassin named fat bastard ( also myers ) to commandeer the mojo , so that our future hero is left completely shagless . \\nmeanwhile , austin is informed of evil's wrong-doing by basil exposition ( michael york ) , and is supplied with his very own time-traveling device in the form of a volkswagen beetle . \\nonce back in 1969 , powers meets a foxy cia operative named felicity shagwell ( heather graham ) , and learns of dr . evil's plans to destroy washington dc with a lazer on the moon . \\nin one of the many uproarious jabs at star wars , evil calls the moon base a `death star' . \\nif there ever was a movie that knew from the start it was a complete joke , it's austin powers : the spy who shagged me . \\nap2 has many hilarious moments , much more so , than the original austin powers . \\nbut what it doesn't have is the confident support system that the first boasted , and the jokes are now more scattershot and hit-and-miss . \\nwhile myers has a knack for delivering clever , inspired gags , he sometimes doesn't know when to call it quits . \\nthe hilarious scene in the original involving mustafa ( will ferrell ) and his refusal to die is played out here in a disappointing and tired manner . \\nrobert wagner , as dr . evil's #2 man , has only one scene early on in the film , where he lacks all the focus of the character . \\none nice surprise is rob lowe , as the young #2 , who patterns wagner's voice and movements right down to a tee . \\nthere are more recycled jokes from the predecessor , including kristen johnston as ivana humpalot ( an unfunny rendition of alotta fagina ) . \\nbut myers has clearly put so much dedication into this project , and many bits are side-splittingly funny . \\ndon't miss an extended visual gag in a tent , where the shadows leave much to the imagination . . . . \\nof the new characters , graham doesn't leave much of an impression . \\nher performance is merely okay , and she lacks the gung-ho enthusiasm that made elizabeth hurley so enjoyable before her . \\nand as for fat bastard . . . \\nwell , he provides one or two hilarious moments , but all of the obesity jokes and bathroom talk go too far . \\nbut my most severe complaint : mr . bigglesworth was only in one scene ! ! \\nbut , with gritted teeth , i managed to get over that . \\nthis sequel will not leave fans disappointed ; it's more often than not a laugh riot . \\nand , i look optimistically to the future , where i foresee more installments to the austin powers collection . \\nif myers can up the quota of fresh ideas , we should be in store for much more . \\n ( c ) 1999 , jamey hughton . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \\njamey hughton ( 15 ) has written a weekly column in the starphoenix , saskatoon , sk since november , 1997 . \\nhe was a 1999 writing finalist in the canadian ytv achievement awards . \\n\",\n",

       " b'you know , i never really wondered what the tarzan films would have been like had tarzan been an old man . \\nwhile watching instinct , i couldn\\'t help but acknowledge the way the film carelessly rehashes the well-explored themes of those earlier movies . \\neven beside the tarzan comparison , instinct just isn\\'t a very good film . \\nit\\'s painfully idealistic , manipulative , and silly . \\ni didn\\'t hate it -- it\\'s simply impossible for me to hate any film starring anthony hopkins ; furthermore , most of the acting is quite good . \\nbut i can recognize instinct for what it is beyond my subjective admiration for the actors involved . \\ni can also recognize reasons for wanting to make instinct , and it\\'s pretty clear that this could have been a good film with a massive script overhaul and a director less interested in imitating movies like patch adams . \\nthings start off in the predictable way , as director jon turtletaub introduces us to our hero , theo caulder ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , an ambitious , young psychiatrist under the supervision of an experienced , old psychiatrist ( donald sutherland ) . \\ncaulder soon finds himself involved in the case of his life , the one he thinks will make him famous . \\nthe subject is ethan powell ( hopkins ) , an anthropologist who has been living among gorillas in africa for the past two years . \\npowell has been charged with the brutal murders of several men in africa , and it\\'s now caulder\\'s job to find out of he\\'s mentally competent enough to stand trial . \\nthrough a series of short sessions , caulder tries to put together the complex psyche of powell . \\neven though it really is an old man version of tarzan , much of this central idea is rather interesting . \\nas i said , hopkins is captivating for every second he\\'s on screen ; he has a way of convincing us that he\\'s not acting , that he\\'s actually a man who has just spent two years of his life living with a family of wild gorillas . \\nthe character himself isn\\'t very interesting -- he\\'s just an anthropologist who really likes gorillas -- but hopkins makes him interesting with subtleties both in speech and action . \\ngooding jr . does strong work opposite hopkins , playing caulder as an intelligent and flawed individual . \\nthe screenplay , written by gerald di pego and \" suggested by \" a novel by daniel quinn , gives us no background information on caulder , but that seems to be the point ( he has no time for friends because he\\'s obsessed with his work ) . \\nnonetheless , these two actors are essentially the entire list of things that are good about instinct . \\nunfortunately , filmmaking this inept can mangle the effect of even the best acting . \\nturtletaub and di pego are both guilty of instinct\\'s artistic failure , for they work together to make the dumbest , most cliche-ridden environment in which their characters are to live , and they do so by means of brainless subplots . \\nfirst , we have the prison warden subplot . \\nthe prison warden is evil and wants to stop caulder\\'s progress at any cost ; if this means taking caulder off the powell case , then that\\'s fine . \\nthere\\'s also the prison guard subplot . \\nthe prison guard is played by john ashton ; the prison guard seems to enjoy mercilessly beating upon the psychotics under his supervision , and he\\'s instrumental in helping the story along to its obvious conclusion . \\nthen there\\'s the daughter subplot , in which maura tierney ( playing the daughter ) must look very upset a lot of the time ; after all , she is the daughter of a deranged man . \\nif some of this stuff sounds familiar , that\\'s because they\\'re all devices that have been used and reused in countless other films . \\nthe evil doctor in patch adams is not unlike the evil warden here . \\nthe offensive caricatures of mental patients lack the depth that the similar portrayals in one flew over the cuckoo\\'s nest had . \\nashton\\'s evil prison guard pales in comparison to clancy brown\\'s in the shawshank redemption . \\nhopkins\\' performance will undoubtedly remind audiences of his turn in the silence of the lambs . \\nand then there\\'s the whole tarzan thing , which is more than a little bit obvious through the entire film . \\nperhaps what irritates me most about instinct is the half-hearted attempt at philosophical depth . \\nthe message powell brings back from the wild is not a subtle one : he thinks that humans are \" takers , \" that they expand and kill and that we should all just live like gorillas . \\ni can sympathize with that , but only when it\\'s in a compelling film . \\nthis is the kind of stupid movie -- just like patch adams -- in which a big group of characters ( psychotic inmates , in this case ) rise against the evil forces oppressing them by tearing up playing cards . \\nwhat does any of this have to do with a man who has just spent two years of his life with gorillas ? \\nif all the subplots of instinct had been left on the cutting room floor , we would have had a thirty-minute movie far superior to the two-hour one that i watched today . \\nif the central idea had been developed beyond the old man tarzan premise , then we would really have had something interesting -- a movie that doesn\\'t rely on the strength of its actors . \\n',\n",

       " b'by the time dennis quaid , the ostensible star of switchback , makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark , you may find yourself wondering why he bothered . \\nafter all , writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines . \\nthe first finds amarillo , texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction . \\nas olmstead begins his investigation , we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects . \\nlane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination . \\nall the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work , and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the other\\'s protagonist . \\nbut then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse . \\nlacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years . \\nhe\\'s not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau , they\\'ve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise . \\ntwo months earlier , lacrosse\\'s own son was kidnapped by the killer , and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere . \\nlacrosse knows his killer\\'s work , and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game . \\nit wouldn\\'t be fair to reduce everything that\\'s wrong with switchback to quaid\\'s presence , but it\\'s a pretty good place to start . \\nthere\\'s a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor , dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation . \\nwe can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed , sourpuss pucker ; we can tell he\\'s grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp . \\na more flexible performer might have given weight to the character , pulling the audience into his haunted intensity , making switchback _his_ film . \\nquaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated . \\nit\\'s tough to become emotionally invested in a character\\'s turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes . \\neven without quaid , it doesn\\'t appear that switchback would have stayed on course . \\nthe early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy , building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat . \\nunfortunately , stuart tips his hand far too early in the game , both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal . \\nonce the mystery of the killer\\'s identity is dispatched , the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable . \\nin fact , \" stale and predictable \" describes the direction that switchback takes in general , falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere , a climactic fistfight on board a freight train , and edgy law enforcement agents . \\nit\\'s too bad stuart wasn\\'t willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead , far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film . \\nplayed with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey , he\\'s a wonderful , unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions . \\na film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling . \\ninstead , stuart places his trust in a \" name \" star who can\\'t carry the material . \\nmaybe next time he\\'ll throw away that one crucial page in the script , the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story . \\n',\n",

' \\nin down with america , the line `roswell' is highly absent . \\nwith an about ten minute running time , down with america effortlessly sidesteps every clich ? that the conspiracy films fell into , makes jokes at them at the same time , and provides us with funny and memorable characters . \\nagain , i have seen movies that have gone on two hours with characters i couldn't care less about . \\nthe film , as previously stated , concerns a federal agent ( peter roach ) , an obsessed librarian ( meri stevens ) , a mystery man ( joe kaczkowski ) , and two people obsessed with silence in the library ( robb sherman , kevin flowers ) . \\nthe plot : a book containing the secrets of all anarchists is hidden in ? a public library where it can be viewed by all . \\nfrom there we go into a delightful parody . \\nthe federal agent claims his sovereign right to alter the truth , the librarian goes on a diatribe about the sanctity of books . \\nwe spend our time laughing at fairly idiotic jokes that are performed much too well considering the lack of coaching of the cast . \\nalthough the actors and actresses are in small roles and give a whole new meaning to `no-name' , it ends up being the no-name people who do a good job , delivering better performances as comic villains than half the crap that hollywood turns out . \\nfor once , i don't have a url that i know offhand to give you as to where to locate the film online . \\ni can only say that you should find my previous reviews of l'auto and les x-files and look up the rigormortis productions site in and of itself . \\nit's almost as much fun as the film . \\n\",\n",
       " b'the realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities . \\nthe best tales of the genre deal with mankind\\'s struggle for survival or knowledge . \\nsuch popular and noteworthy tomes as \" stranger in a strange land \" by robert heinlein , \" childhood\\'s end \" by arthur c . clarke and \" man in the high castle \" and \" do androids dream of electric sheep \" by philip k . dick all deal with man\\'s need for identity and struggle for self worth . \\nhollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since it\\'s beginnings . \\nmost films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved . \\nit really wasn\\'t until producer george pal , took charge of robert heinlein\\'s novel \" rocketship galileo \" and crafted the film \" destination moon \" , that \\'sci-fi\\' ( as it is commonly referred to ) , came into it\\'s own . \\nfrom there , such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick , have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre . \\nwith the release of touchstone pictures \" mission to mars \" , we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe . \\nthe film opens on a summer barbecue , as phil ohlmyer ( jerry o\\'connell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission . \\nwoody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission , and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son . \\nentering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise ) , who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife , maggie ( kim delaney ) . \\nluc consoles jim with woody\\'s assistance . \\nthe three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them . \\nbut jim still longs to set foot on the red planet . \\nthe mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars . \\nthey send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface . \\ngoing out to investigate , luc and his team approach the famed \\'face on mars\\' . \\na strange noise emanates from the rock . \\nas the team tries to scan through the rock with radar , a violent wind storm erupts , creating a vortex that kills all members of the team , save for luc . \\nback on the space station orbiting earth , woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing . \\nluc\\'s interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team . \\nthe second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger . \\nmeteorite showers , explosions , and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planet\\'s surface . \\nthe big question is , is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars . \\nand if so , what is its relationship with us ?

\\nfor the most part , it is because the filmmakers understand \\nthe comic book medium and come up with an appropriate atmosphere to match . \\nthe crow and batman comics call for a dark gothic atmosphere , which the director provided . \\nthe mask features a wacky superhero with off the wall antics , which the casting and cg effects reflect . \\nsuperman \\nis not over the top with colour and flash , and the film reflects this . \\nblade uses common notions of vampires and incorporates them into the film , creating an appropriate atmosphere . \\nthis is in stark contrast to joel schumacher\\'s contrived vision in batman and robin , reflecting the dated atmosphere in the 1960\\'s television show . \\nbatman and robin proved that the director failed to realize one fundamental fact : comics have grown up , and so has the audience ( i\\'m working on a scathing review of batman and robin and will post it up when i\\'m ready ) . \\nwhich brings me back to blade . \\nalthough he may be a familiar character to some , due to his appearances in the spider-man animated show on fox , one will find no single trace of the warm-and-fuzzy vampire hunter as depicted in the cartoon . \\nthe film depicts a vicious vampire killer that \\nuses every single means at his disposal to reach his ends . \\nthe end results are not pretty by any means . \\nthe story elements work very well -- for a comic book story . \\nscreenwriter david goyer ( who also wrote the crow ) incorporates interesting elements of vampire lore , using science to explain many of the ideas often dismissed in vampire films . \\nthis is presented through karen , a hematologist portrayed by n\\'bushe wright . \\nthis leads to inventive use of standard medical treatments to kill vampires . \\nadd this \\nto the neat little gadgets that blade uses ( including a titanium sword complete with an \" anti-theft device \" ) , and one has an interesting premise . \\nhowever , the film works best as an action film . \\nactor wesley snipes has \\nan extensive background in martial arts ( most of which comes from capoeira , a brazillian form incorporating flashy kicks ) , choreographing every single move . \\nproving that quick , flash cutting edits are no substitute for choreographed fight sequences ( see batman and robin for a \\ngood example of that ) , wesley snipes dazzles the audience with some incredible fight scenes . \\nregardless , this film is far from perfect . \\nthe film suffers from at least one major plot hole , regarding the summoning of the blood god . \\nthe ritual requires that a number of pure blood vampires are standing on \\nmarked squares , yet one of them is viciously murdered , allowing the ritual to pass ( and the murdered vampire is later shown standing on the square ) . \\nobvious continuity errors also surface , especially during a scene where deacon frost takes a drag on his cigarette and is not exhaling it in the next frame ( there is no trace of smoke either ) . \\nmuch of the special effects are not that spectacular either . \\nwhile vampire disintegration scenes are intriguing to watch , other cgi ( computer generated imagery ) effects are almost slapped together , which is surprising when given the amount of time the film was given to be released ( the film\\'s release date was pushed back multiple times ) . \\nscenes with computer generated blood look extremely fake , knocking the believability factor down a few notches ( but then , i\\'m really hard to impress ) . \\nthe film\\'s r rating comes from gory violence , but the lack of \\nrealism made me wonder why it got such a rating ( for realistic violence , \\nwatch \" saving private ryan \" ) . \\nthe overuse of cgi in films has made me yearn for the days of director george romero and makeup wizard rob bottin , both pioneers in the art of gore without extensive use of cgi . \\nstill , scenes involving non-cgi special effects do surface ( and look much more impressive ) , such as one particularly gruesome scene where a vampire tries to use blade\\'s sword without deactivating the \" anti-theft device \" . \\nwesley snipes is the saving grace behind what would have otherwise been a muddled mess . \\nwhile not talking much , he is a grand physical presence , leaving other comic book superheroes in the dust . \\na decent ( by comic book film standards ) storyline also helps . \\n',\n",
       " b'these days , we are witnessing the deluge of films based on old , cult tv shows . \\nmost of the times , the fans of these shows shudder thinking what could hollywood hacks of the present do with the memories of their past . \\nbut , some five or six years ago , there weren\\'t that many movies and the trend didn\\'t look that depressing . \\nso , the people who , like the author of this review , grew up watching flintstones , popular 1960s animated series about \" modern stone age \" family , weren\\'t particularly worried when the word came about live action remake . \\nafter all , the producer behind the project was steven spielberg and , if anything else , at least the special effects would be good . \\nthe plot revolves about flintstones , family set in fictious stone age \" town \" of bedrock , whose members enjoy the lifestyle of 1950s middle class america . \\nfred flinstone ( john goodman ) works in the quarry , and one day he helps his best friend and neighbour barney rubble ( rick moranis ) and his wife betty ( rosie o\\'donnell ) to adopt a baby . \\nto return the favour , barney switches his results of aptitude test with fred , and , based on that , fred gets well-paid job in management . \\nbut , of course , this is just a sham - corrupt official cliff vandercave ( kyle maclachlan ) and his sultry secretary sharon stone ( halle berry ) need a scapegoat for their embezzlement scheme . \\nin the meantime , fred\\'s wife wilma ( elizabeth perkins ) must face her mother ( elizabeth taylor ) who can\\'t stand fred . \\non the superficial level , the flintstones did the excellent job in bringing the animated series to life . \\ncomputer effects are flawless , and the costumes , settings and other details are authentic for all the fans of the show . \\nunfortunately , problems with this film start with inadequate casting - rick moranis is too thin for the role of barney , while the cartoon betty used to be much skinnier than rosie o\\'donnell . \\nbut the greatest problem of all is plot , or to be precise , the lack of plot . \\nsome thirty six screenwriters made sure that the plot of the film is lame , original characters one-dimensional , and many elements of the story , like embezzlement and inter-office politics , totally incomprehensible for the little children , the main targeted audience of this film . \\nresult is almost unwatchable mess , occasionally saved mostly by excellent acting ( elizabeth perkins was right on mark as wilma ) and one of the classic example of mortal hollywood disease known as \" high concept \" . \\nafter great hype , movie quickly sank into oblivion and the fans of the show returned to the animated version . \\nall in all , film isn\\'t that bad , but only the hard core fans and nostalgics can find more than guilty pleasure in it . \\n',\n",
       " b'there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it\\'s just that none of them happen to be actors . \\nthe stars i\\'m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie\\'s \" outer space \" ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . \\nyes , in terms of acting , the star power is . \\n . \\n . \\nwell , more like a falling star . \\nkinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead . \\nlost in space , as if you really didn\\'t know , is based on the 60\\'s sci-fi television series of the same name . \\nit\\'s the year 2058 , and earth\\'s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . \\njohn robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . \\nearth\\'s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john\\'s family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . \\njohn\\'s family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) . \\ndespite everyone\\'s reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space . \\nunknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission . \\ndr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to \" destroy robinson family \" ! \\nwhen everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . \\nas for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground . \\nit\\'s hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ? \\nchabert is basically the only one to overdo it , sounding like a whiny munchkin on helium . \\nif you , like me , were convinced by commercials that her voice was altered for some sort of plot twist where her body would be taken over by aliens , you\\'re wrong ! \\nthat\\'s just her normal voice ! \\nin yet another example of a \" friend \" faltering on the big screen , leblanc is so incredibly dull and yet so obviously trying so hard to be so incredibly charming ( make sense ? ) , it makes you want to shove his ass out the escape pod corridor without an escape pod . \\ngraham is a babe - thank goodness there was something for me to think about during this film . \\nhurt , the black hole of excitement , sucks up any energy that might have been left . \\nif hurt were available in tablet form , he would be a prescription strength sleeping pill . \\njohnson isn\\'t dull , he\\'s just lame as the young know it all who winds up saving everybody\\'s ass all the time . \\nwant an example of how cool this kid can be ? \\nhow about when he convinces the robot to think with its heart and reconsider killing the family ? \\nhey , don\\'t laugh - the thing actually listened to the mr . rogers-would-be-proud sentiment . \\nbut alas , if you thought a character couldn\\'t be much worse , there was rogers as the epitome of generic ( or , mother as she was known ) . \\nwhy hire an actress ? \\nthey could\\'ve had a white cardboard cutout with the word mom printed on it . \\nnow that would\\'ve had some pizzazz ! \\nlost in space luckily doesn\\'t suffer in every single category that it could have . \\nthe special effects are crisp , clear , and at least mildly captivating , unlike any of the presences onscreen save it be oldman , who plays his evil character with a great deal of fun and finesse . \\nunfortunately , oldman is locked away for most of the film , giving us nothing but ample mocking opportunities to enjoy . \\nwhile the special effects are pleasing to the eye , they are nothing you couldn\\'t find in most modern sci-fi films . \\ncontact , for example , far exceeds this film in terms of imagery and imagination . \\nlost in space just has too many shortcomings to ever be considered a work of cinematic art , with numerous contradictions ( the time travel aspect was horribly flawed ! ) , wooden and corny acting , worse dialogue , and an ending so disappointing , you\\'d be happier to have seen the entire robinson family get blown to smithereens . \\nthen again , with an ending like this film has , it\\'s obvious a sequel is already being considered . \\nwhat an awful note to end on , knowing there could be more of this in a year or two . \\nthe attempt to be family oriented is commendable , but lost in space is lost with the illusion that special effects and the nostalgia of a classic tv series being revisited is enough to satisfy all age groups . \\nwell , danger potential movie goers ! \\ndanger ! \\nthis movie crash lands without ever breaking thru the atmosphere of mediocrity . \\n',\n",
       " b'there is a striking scene early in \" city of angels , \" where all the angels who live unseen in our midst , gather at the beach to watch the sun rise . \\nthe camera moves above them , showing the endless rows of ethereal men and women , all garbed in black . \\nthen the camera moves in on the face of seth , an angel played by nicolas cage , and as the sun rises , he smiles and his entire face lights up . \\nyou see , the angels can hear music in sunrises and sunsets , but they cannot feel a human touch . \\nit is an important scene for several reasons . \\nfirst of all , it is one of many instances in the film that make angels seem thoroughly plausible . \\nthe film presents these fantastic beings as normal-looking people who drift amongst the inhabitants of earth , watching what goes on with little interference . \\nthere are none of the standard , hokey angel references used in recent films like \" angels in the outfield \" ( 1994 ) or \" michael \" ( 1996 ) . \\nthe angels here are stark and believable . \\nthis early scene on the beach is also an important scene of juxtaposition , for its shows how god\\'s angels can enjoy aspects of the earth that human cannot , and yet they are denied so many simple human pleasures , like feeling the sand on their feet or the waves lapping at their legs , or the smell of the salt in the air . \\nthere is an inherent tragedy in being an angel , although there is much beauty in it as well . \\nthey eternally walk the earth , listening to our thoughts , touching us in our pain , and leading the dying to heaven . \\nlike human existence , being an angel is often confused and unsure . \\n \" city of angels \" is essentially a love story , between seth and a human , a beautiful but sad heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan ) . \\nhe first sees her when he is in her operating room , waiting to lead the soul of her dying patient to heaven . \\nmaggie is distraught , doing everything in her power to stop the man from dying on her table , and seth is moved by her efforts and , more importantly , her overwhelming sadness when the patient dies . \\nangels have the limited power to soothe humans in time of misery and pain , and seth does what he can with his invisible touch , but it\\'s not enough . \\nhe wants to be with her and share her pain , not just stand back at a distance . \\nhe learns that the only way to fulfill his desire for human love and touch is for him to \" fall \" and become human . \\nhe learns this from another fallen angel , played by dennis franz ( \" n . y . p . d . \\nblue \" ) in a touching and humorous performance . \\nsitting at a diner together , franz tells cage\\'s character about how wonderful it is to be human - to be able to taste food , feel another person\\'s skin , smell the air , and most importantly , have a loving wife and children . \\nof course , there is pain to go along with all this , but for seth , it will be worth it . \\n \" city of angels \" is something of a reinterpretation of wim wender\\'s haunting 1988 film \" wings of desire . \" \\nwenders\\' film was more like a poem - it was the feeling , the emotion that truly mattered over what actually happened . \\nthe americanized version moves the location from divided berlin to broken los angeles , and the emphasis shifts onto the relationship between the immortal angel and the mortal human . \\nand , unlike most foreign films that are re-made into hollywood fare , it doesn\\'t suffer extensive damage . \\nthis may be because director brad silberling ( \" casper \" ) and screenwriter dana stevens ( \" blink \" ) wanted to make \" city of angels \" its own movie - inspired by \" wings of desire , \" but not an attempt to copy it . \\nand yet , \" city of angels \" is not a typical hollywood movie . \\nit is beautifully filmed in lush colors by cinematographer john seale ( \" the english patient \" ) , whose sweeping aerial shots and golden lighting make los angeles into an almost unrecognizable new world . \\nseale creates many striking visuals : in addition to the beach scene , there is a wonderful sequence in a circular library where all the angels appear at banisters all around , looking down at seth as he watches maggie walk by . \\nwhile the film travels along a charted plot , it takes time to develop its characters and situations ; it sheds light on the boundaries between what is earthly and what is heavenly , and shows just how thin those boundaries are . \\nboth cage and ryan give soulful , soft-spoken performances . \\nryan , who is usually so bouncy and energetic , truly embodies a sadness that can only be alleviated by a heavenly touch . \\ncage projects all his desire and longing to be human in simple , heartfelt gazes , and speaks with the comforting , knowing voice that only an angel could have . \\nwhat is most striking about \" city of angels \" is that stevens has added a new ending to the screenplay , which is both unexpected and challenging . \\nit\\'s not a formulaic hollywood ending , because it is both sad and uplifting at the same time . \\nit doesn\\'t give the audience what it thinks it wants at the end of a romance . \\ninstead , it offers something much better , something that speaks to the depths of what it means to be human and alive . \\n____________________________________________ visit \" charlie don\\'t surf ! \" \\nan eclectic collection of film reviews by james kendrick http : //www . bigfoot . com/~jimkendrick \\n|| e-mail : jimkendrick@bigfoot . com \\n',\n",

\\nand how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ? \\ni can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment . \\nthe most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence . \\nthe character in question , dana ( angela zimmely ) , has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated . \\na priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken . \\nhe picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken , taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever . \\nwhen she starts to leave , the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life , walks out , and makes like it wants to be crucified by her . \\nthe presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her . \\nwhen it finally catches up to her , she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ . \\nthe box for the film claims \" because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture , parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 . \\ncontains nudity and graphic violence \" . \\nwhile both is certainly true , there doesn\\'t seem to be much of either in any large amounts . \\nbesides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump , a semi-graphic self-surgery scene , and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting ) , most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety . \\nas for nudity , it is very sparse , but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised , torn , and bloodied by the dragging incident . \\nice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com . \\nit has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent . \\nbesides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com ) , a making-of video is also available called on thin ice . \\ni haven\\'t had the opportunity to see the documentary , but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed , if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest ) , conducted the atmosphere on set . \\n',\n",

       " b'when i saw the trailer for this film , i laughed harder than i had in quite some time . \\nwhile i was therefore pretty well psyched to see it , i was ever mindful that a trailer can make even the most mediocre film look good . \\ni\\'m happy to say that there\\'s something about mary is not one of those trailer let-downs . \\nin fact , watching this film was quite a fine way to spend two hours . \\nthe film opens up in flashback to 1985 , at a high school in cumberland , rhode island . \\nted stroehmann ( ben stiller ) is a social reject who can\\'t seem to get a date to the upcoming prom , until he comes to the defense of the mentally retarded warren ( w . \\nearl brown ) , who\\'s being harassed by one of the school jocks . \\nit seems warren\\'s sister is the campus queen , mary jensen ( cameron diaz ) , who is impressed with ted\\'s willingness to stand up for her defenseless brother , despite a very real chance of getting beaten up . \\nmary takes an immediate liking to ted and asks him to the prom . \\nted was just flattered that she even knew his name . \\nunfortunately , prom night is ruined when ted has an accident with his zipper ( at which every man in the theater will wince ) , and is sent to the hospital . \\nfast forward to the present , where ted has cleaned himself up , now writes for a magazine , but has weekly therapy sessions in order to deal with his obsession of the past 13 years : mary , whom he hasn\\'t seen since that fateful day . \\nwith the help of his friend dom ( chris elliott ) , ted hires slimy private investigator pat healy ( matt dillon ) to track down his only love . \\nhowever , when pat finds mary , he falls for her too , and soon the both of them are competing for her affections . \\nthere\\'s something about mary is directed by bobby and peter farrelly , who brought us dumb and dumber and kingpin . \\nnot exactly intelligent comedies , they are of the guilty pleasure variety where you might not want your friends or co-workers to think you had such a great time watching them . \\nwith their current film , the farrelly brothers have come up with something you\\'ll not only enjoy , but also won\\'t mind talking about the next day at the water cooler . \\nthe film succeeds in employing a pretty wide range of comedic styles , from the subtle to the ridiculous , and while a few of the gags might be offensive to some ( seeming like residuals from the farrelly brothers\\' last two films ) they almost all work . \\ni have not seen many movies in the recent past that shoot for the mark and so often hit it dead on . \\none minute you\\'ll be laughing at something ted says , and the next you\\'ll be howling at the sight of a dog dragging him across the floor of mary\\'s apartment . \\none of the great things this film has going for it is ben stiller . \\nhe is perfectly cast in the role of ted , because he\\'s a guy who just looks awkward in almost every situation . \\nted\\'s a nice fellow and tries to do his best , but for some reason or another things just don\\'t always work out . \\nit\\'s comical , but also has that kind of appeal where you really feel for the him and want him to come out on top . \\nactually , i\\'ve liked stiller since he did a short which aired on saturday night live back in the mid-eighties . \\nthe film was like a theatrical trailer for a spoof on the tom cruise/paul newman film the color of money , entitled the hustler of money . \\nin it , stiller played wince ( not vince ) who is taken under the wing of an older man ( played by john mahoney ) to become a big-time bowling hustler . \\nit was parody at its finest , more of which showed up in the short-lived \" the ben stiller show \" on the fox network in late \\'92/early \\'93 . \\nlike \" the critic \" ( which aired on abc , then fox ) , i still mourn that show\\'s cancellation . \\ncameron diaz is absolutely enchanting for most of the film , although her character seems obsessed with perfection in the men she dates , and some of the qualities she looks for make mary look paper-thin at times . \\nhowever , diaz pulls the role off with such panache and charm , that you can still see why she\\'s got guys just falling over each other to be with her . \\nheck , i even found her laugh to be cute , even though i thought it was annoying during an appearance she made on the tonight show last week . \\nmy girlfriend remarked that matt dillon doesn\\'t change , and you know , it\\'s really true . \\nhe and ralph macchio must hang out or something . \\nmaybe they live in dick clark\\'s pool house . \\nanyway , here\\'s another good piece of casting , as dillon slips beautifully into the role of the guy who tries to worm his way into mary\\'s heart . \\nthe supporting performances are also good . \\nchris elliott has a bigger part than in the abyss ( yes , check it out next time ) , and less annoying than in cabin boy . \\nlin shae , who plays mary\\'s neighbor magda ( and also appeared as the landlady in kingpin ) , provides some good laughs , especially in scenes with her benji-like dog , which acts as the focal point for a few of the funniest moments of the film . \\nlee evans , as mary\\'s friend tucker , displays a flexibility in acting and accents which surprises and contributes to an interesting plot twist . \\nthe farrelly brothers and scriptwriters ed decter and john j . strauss keep the comedic pacing going so that there aren\\'t any noticeable times where the film drags . \\nthe only problem i saw was their use of a couple of musicians who provide segues between several key scenes . \\nthey appear out of nowhere and actually sing plot-relevant information right toward the camera . \\nit\\'s a device which was amusing for about three seconds when they opened the film . \\nafter that it got a little annoying , and it\\'s unfortunate that those spots interrupt what would otherwise be a smooth flow . \\nfortunately , filled with sight gags , humorous

       " b'the first species was a moderately-successful science fiction yarn that diverted audiences with some nifty special effects , a few well- paced action sequences , and frequent views of model-turned-actress natasha henstridge sans clothing . \\nhowever , it was definitely not a movie that cried out for a sequel . \\nand , considering the quality of species 2 , it\\'s obvious that mgm should have stopped while they were ahead . \\nthe only thing that distinguishes species 2 is how awful it is . \\nif you throw away the plot , which is characterized by a blatant disregard for intelligence , logic , coherence , and consistency , species 2 actually has a few things to recommend it to a select audience . \\nof course , that audience is primarily comprised of teenage boys ( who , at least in theory , shouldn\\'t be able to get into an \" r \" -rated film ) and connoisseurs of bad movies . \\nthere\\'s enough blood , gore , simulated sex , and bare flesh in species 2 to prevent it from ever becoming boring . \\nthis is a grade z exploitation flick that\\'s ripe for the mystery science theater 3000 treatment . \\nsomewhere , someplace , i recall hearing species 2 described as \" erotic . \" \\ni would love to know who used with that adjective for this movie , because he ( or she ) has a peculiar notion of eroticism . \\nsure , there\\'s a lot of sex and nudity , but it\\'s almost always accompanied by the ripping open of a woman\\'s abdomen as an alien baby claws its way free , splattering blood and gore in all directions . \\nanyone turned on by that is not someone i would care to be sitting next to in a theater . \\ni suppose the main attraction in species 2 is natasha henstridge ( and , to get the obvious question out of the way -- yes , she does remove her top , but only once , and only briefly ) . \\nalthough the character she played in the original species is dead , government scientists still have the dna , and , out of what can only be described as a suicidal impulse , they decide to create another clone . \\nthis creature , dubbed \" eve \" by its creator , dr . laura baker ( played by marg helgenberger , reprising her role ) , is genetically engineered to be kinder and more docile . \\nmeanwhile , man has finally set foot on mars . \\na team of three , led by patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , has traveled to the red planet , but when they return to earth , they bring something with them . \\nross has become a half-human/half-alien hybrid , and he\\'s soon mating like crazy , collecting the blood-soaked children that are the result of each sex session . \\nhis intention is obviously world domination . \\nstanding in his way is that indomitable soldier of fortune from the first film , preston lennox ( michael madsen ) , and one of patrick\\'s fellow astronauts , dennis gamble ( mykelti williamson ) . \\nbut when patrick learns about eve , a female of his kind , there\\'s no damping his ardor . \\ni\\'m not sure what the budget for species 2 was , but a significant portion of it must have gone into paying handsome salaries to several recognizable actors ( as opposed to being diverted into the special effects ) . \\nmichael madsen and marg helgenberger , both back for a second round , are clearly on hand to do as little as they can , grab the money , and run . \\nditto for james cromwell , who plays patrick\\'s father -- \" underused \" is too kind a word to describe his involvement ( \" invisible \" would be more like it ) . \\ngeorge dzundza gets to do a little scenery- chewing as an angry-but-inept general . \\nmeanwhile , justin lazard\\'s performance as patrick is so flat that he makes natasha henstridge\\'s limited abilities look good by comparison . \\nthe only one in the whole production with any energy is mykelti williamson , who is cast in the part of the wisecracking black sidekick . \\ncomplete with cheesy special effects , bare breasts around every narrative corner , and dialogue capable of producing howls of laughter , species 2 has been dumped into the marketplace without advance screenings for critics . \\ndirector peter medak , a journeyman film maker with a significant list of mediocre movies on his resume , has added another forgettable title , but at least he appears to have had fun doing it , which is more than can be said of anyone trying to take this film with even a scintilla of seriousness . \\ndo i recommend the movie ? \\nabsolutely not , but i will admit that species 2 is dopey enough that it didn\\'t try my patience to the degree that some pseudo-intellectual bad movies do . \\nhere\\'s hoping there\\'s no species 3 . \\n',\n",

' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there . \\nthe goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict . \\nthe premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist . \\nwe begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely . \\nlater he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right . \\nthe fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling . \\nthis opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone . \\nthe man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him . \\nin fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while . \\nbut in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story . \\neventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police . \\nwe met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time . \\ntwo other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies . \\nit was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film . \\nhe also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story . \\nbut absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo . \\neverything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities . \\nhowever , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential . \\nby continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax . \\neveryone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction . \\nbut , as the film's tagline says , `last night , one of us went off . ' \\nfor reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) . \\nthe aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight . \\nat the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then . \\nthis premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard . \\nhe does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form . \\nthe aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not . \\nin the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world . \\nhowever , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is . \\nthe main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) . \\nfor example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending . \\nand that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense . \\nironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world . \\nwith `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message . \\nstill , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable . \\nthere's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does . \\nthe story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years . \\n`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world . \\n\",\n",

       " b'while it was part of former yugoslavia , my country , croatia , used to be almost completely ignored by western films in general . \\nwords \" croatia \" and \" croatians \" were unheard , even in movies whose plots actually took place on croatian locations . \\nthe rare exception was the dogs of war , 1980 adaptation of frederick forsyth\\'s bestselling novel , yet that rare occasion only added insult to the injury , by mentioning croatians in most unflattering context . \\nin a single line they are referred as a bunch of mean people , probably terrorists , who happen to remove parts of arm dealers\\' stomachs when they are unsatisfied with the quality of merchandise . \\nsame line also illustrates the milieu where the movie takes place - dark and violent world of shady international deals with the blurred boundaries between business , politics and crime . \\nthe movie protagonist , shannon ( christopher walken ) is a mercenary who spent the best years of his life fighting numerous little wars all over the globe . \\nhis latest job is a intelligence mission for powerful mining corporation that demands information about political climate in west african nation of zangaro . \\nshannon arrives in that country only to find oppressive regime of president kimba , bloodthirsty madman whose brutality crushed any opposition and scared almost any westerners away . \\nafter being arrested and tortured by kimba\\'s secret police , shannon leaves country with a help of british journalist north ( colin blakely ) . \\nupon return , he is approached by mining company again , but this time they want him to plan and execute the coup d\\'etat against kimba . \\nshannon reluctantly agrees and assembles small group of his surviving mercenary friends who begin meticulous preparation for another small war . \\nthing that separates the dogs of war from conventional action movies , especially those made in 1980s , is its authenticity , almost close to documentary . \\nit shouldn\\'t surprise anyone , because the author of the novel , frederick forsyth , made reputation by blending fiction with real life , thus creating interesting , exciting yet very believable plots for his books . \\nthose plots were also responsible for few very successful 1970s thrillers , and one of them , zinnemman\\'s the day of the jackal , is now considered a classic in that genre . \\nthis one deals with soldiers of fortune , ancient tradition that was resurrected in great turmoil of 1960s and 1970s and filled the void left by vanishing colonial empires . \\nunlike wild geese , that used it as a pretext for conventional action adventure , script by george malko and gary de vore ( author whose death last year became real life mystery ) is serious , and instead of action puts emphasis on characters and prosaic details of their work . \\nthe movie doesn\\'t try to romanticise the mercenary profession nor glorify mercenaries as some kind of superheroes ; they are simply shown as deadly yet expendable tool of powerful forces with questionable agenda . \\nchristopher walken played in many movies , yet very rarely we can see him in a leading role . \\nhis performance in this film perhaps isn\\'t breathtaking , yet adequate . \\nhis notoriously expressionless face is perfect illustration of the disillusioned , world- weary man whose alienation from the \" normal \" way of life becomes complete and only remaining ideal is loyalty to the shrinking circle of friends . \\nalthough the movie doesn\\'t lack capable actors , their roles are miniature compared with walken\\'s , and only colin blakely as cynical reporter has opportunity to portray his character . \\nhowever , those who look familiar faces would find them plenty in the dogs of war - tom berenger , paul freeman , jo beth williams , victoria tennant ( in brief cameo ) , and biggest surprise is ed o\\'neill ( of married with children fame ) as shannon\\'s reluctant colleague . \\nthis was the first major production for john irvin , and it shows why he earned the reputation of capable , yet second class director . \\nwith the good script he can make very good movie , with the bad script he can make real mess . \\nluckily , the dogs of war had a good script . \\nirvin\\'s direction was very ascetic and it gave the movie almost documentary feel . \\nthe only distraction is dramatic music of geoffrey burgon , used on the wrong places . \\nin the final battle scene , where we can see mercenaries at work , irvin shows us that modern warfare means superior firepower and tactics , unlike 1980s ramboesque fantasies that rely on macho superheroes . \\nunfortunately , by making battle realistic irvin made it somewhat less attractive and his sloppy editing also didn\\'t help . \\nbut , despite those shortcomings , this movie remains interesting and rare combination of action thriller and gritty , realistic political drama . \\n',\n",

       " b\"a highly intelligent life form that is completely electronic in nature , beams itself onto a russian science vessel . \\nwell , this is the point where the movie strays from becoming a decent and original movie and simply becomes a predictable sci-fi thriller . \\nanyhow , this life form takes control of the computers on the russian vessel then starts creating highly advanced robots to help it in its gruesome task of exterminating the ? virus' known as man . \\nthe original crew of the russian vessel is all but exterminated , and then a hapless crew on a tug discovers the derelict ship and tries to salvage it . \\nno more needs to be said as to what happens and where the conflict lies , the movie is that predictable . \\nthe story is full of very shallow characters that don't do much other than subsist . \\nthe captain of the tug , played by donald sutherland , makes irrational choice after irrational choice leaving the audience wondering as to how he has survived long enough to reach his age ( looks to be in his 60's ) . \\nto add to this we're shown this motley crew that at times seems to be highly skilled in specific fields , and at others seems barely capable of basic tasks . \\nsome of the supposed capabilities of the characters leads one to wonder what they are doing on a tug transporting cargo in the middle of the pacific , in a typhoon no less . \\nnone of the characters seem to work together at all ; they are always bickering and vying for some form of control . \\nthis makes no sense what so ever and only takes away from the story , a story that is full of holes and is extremely predictable . \\nall the flaws of the actual story are only helped along by the special effects . \\nthe waves that are generated to be part of the typhoon make it look like boat was is small model sitting in a tub and someone is simply creating waves . \\nit looks genuinely fake , granted trying to recreate a typhoon or hurricane cannot be easy by any stretch of the imagination but having the storm approach in a style similar to the huge wave of deep impact only ends up looking corny and amateurish . \\nalso on the topic of flaws , the robotics that the advanced life form creates seem to move extremely slowly , why ? \\nif this life form that is so advanced as to be able to create these robotics , should it not be able to create them move faster ? \\nregardless , the special effects in this movie in many cases take away from the film rather than add to it . \\nas to the actual casting for the movie , finally there is nothing to complain about . \\nthe actors were superb , but then again it is highly doubtful that chimpanzees would have had difficulty acting the roles . \\nhaving the cast that was present probably saved this movie from being an absolute catastrophe . \\nwatching these actors act this story out made it bearable , if barely . \\nthe one saving grace of this movie is that it was highly action packed and there always seemed to be something happening . \\nso if you are going into this movie not expecting to see anything grand and are only going to kill some time and watch a mediocre sci-fi thriller then you won't be too disappointed . \\nas the movie is but the latest in a genre that was originally created by aliens , it does little more than try to cash in on that aspect . \\nthis movie would be best left for video and even then you might be advised to simply wait for one of the major networks to air it on tv . \\n\",\n",

       " b'when quentin tarantino made \" pulp fiction \" , he was not only making the greatest film of the 90s ; he was also making what i believe to be the most influential movie of all time . \\nbut before you send me hate-mail for not giving that title to \" citizen kane \" , hear me out . \\nmuch like \" citizen kane \" , \" pulp fiction \" has changed movie making forever . \\nbut i think the latter has had a tad more impact . \\n \" pulp fiction \" has actually ushered in a new era of film making . \\nit has altered the way films will be viewed . \\n \" fiction \" has spawned so many imitations , i\\'ve lost count . \\nsure , some have been excellent ( \" bound \" and \" the usual suspects \" spring immediately to mind ) , but any serious movie-goer recognizes \" pulp fiction \" as the original neo-noir of the 90s . \\nin this review , i hope to change all the people\\'s minds who have criticized it for it\\'s excessive profanity and violence ( which , by the way , isn\\'t really that graphic ) . \\nthe most brilliant aspect of tarantino\\'s masterpiece is the screenplay . \\nit is filled with so much classic dialogue ( the \" quarter pounder with cheese \" speech will go down in history ) , it should be required reading for any film student , if it isn\\'t already . \\nthe story ( told in unorthodox non-linear format ) centers around three main episodes , all of which eventually intertwine . \\nthe first , titled \" vincent vega and marcellus wallace\\'s wife \" , deals with a very loaded john travolta ( i forgot to mention the cool heroin shoot-up sequence ) taking mia wallace ( a star-making performance by uma thurman ) , his bosses wife , out on a date to a cool 50s restaurant called jack rabbit slim\\'s . \\nthey talk for a while ( with the occasional \" uncomfortable silence \" ) , mostly about a guy called tony rocky horror . \\nafter giving marcellus\\' new bride a foot massage , he was thrown off a building and into a greenhouse , giving him a \" speech impediment \" . \\nthey also partake in a cool dance contest and end up twisting to the chuck berry classic \" you never can tell \" . \\ni won\\'t reveal the rest of the story , but i\\'ll definitely say that it turns out to be a real bummer of a night , despite the cool trophy they win . \\nthe second story ( the least of the three but still four stars ) stars bruce willis ( proving he can play someone other than john mcclain in the \" die hard \" flicks ) as boxer butch coolidge . \\npreviously in the film ( like i said , it\\'s told in non-linear form ) , he had made a deal with marcellus wallace that he would take a fall in a match . \\nas it turns out , he not only doesn\\'t take the fall , but he ends up actually killing his opponent . \\nhe takes a cab to his half-witted girlfriend\\'s apartment , and to make a long story short , ends up going back to his own place to retrieve a gold watch , sort of a family heirloom explained by christopher walken in a hilarious flash-back sequence . \\non his way home , he bumps into ( literally ) marcellus . \\nthe two winde up prisoner to two hillbilly sex murderers , which results in the infamous \" gimp \" scene , which is very reminicent of the \" squeal like a pig ! \" \\nscene from \" deliverance \" . \\nthe last ( and best , in my opinion ) of the episodes features john travolta ( again ) and samuel l . jackson ( in the best performance of any supporting actor ever ) as two slightly off-kilter hitmen trying to rid themselves of a bloody car . \\nthey seek help with a friend of jackson\\'s ( played by the q-man himself ) , desperately in need of a stress ball . \\nthey end up calling a \" cleaner \" of sorts , played by the god among men harvey keitel , to help them out . \\nin the end , the story brilliantly loops around itself , actually ending where it began . \\nif you haven\\'t already seen the film ( or even if you have , for that matter ) , i suggest you invest your money in a copy of the letterbox collectors edition . \\nit features two previously unreleased scenes and the original film restored how it was originally meant to be seen . \\nearlier today , i bought this version and watched it a few hours ago . \\nwhat the pan-and-scan did to this movie is inexcusable . \\nthat version cut out , like , half the movie . \\nwhat i have missed in the past years of viewing this flick is amazing . \\nfor instance , when travolta and jackson are in the apartment near the end , the widescreen version allows you to see that several things on the walls make crosses . \\nthis might help explain the divine intervention that takes place . \\njust a theory . . . \\none of the things that pisses people off so much about this movie is that tarantino borrowed alot of scenes from other movies ( i . e . \\n \" psycho \" \" kiss me deadly \" , \" deliverance \" , etc . ) . \\nbut why shouldn\\'t he ?

       " b'usually when a blockbuster comes out , it\\'s loaded with effects , stars , bad scripts , and plenty of action . \\nmystery men may contain an all-star cast , and efects , but the clever script and characters are what really works , which is rare to see this year . \\nthe film is based upon the comic book series \" the flaming carrot \" by bob burden , in which 3 wanna be super heroes try and fight crime , only to be out done by the real hero of champion city , captain amazing ( greg kinnear ) . \\nthings go a little haywire , when the sinister casanova frankenstein ( geoffrey rush ) is released into the city , where he captures captain amazing , and plans to wreak havoc upon champion city . \\nwell , the trio decide to take matters in their own hands , by saving the city , but first they need some assitance . \\nthis is where the film takes a turn for the better . \\nin the beggining , there were only 3 wanna be heroes . \\n \" blue raja ( hank azaria ) , \" mr . furious ( ben stiller ) and \" the shoveller ( william h . macy ) . \\nsure they were enterataining , but their acts grew old fast . \\nthat is until they aquire \" invisible boy \" ( kel mitchell ) , and \" the bowler \" ( janeane garafalo ) and \" mr . splein \" ( paul reubens ) , 2 of which rescue the film from becoming a disastorous mess . \\nthankfully , the original 3 heroes become amusing , with some support of reuben and garfalo on screen . \\nthe whole premise is rather ridiculous , but packs a few punches to keep interest . \\nfor one , the film is considerably clever . \\nit literally pokes fun at super hero films , like batman and robin , superman etc . in fact , many scenes are similar to batman and robin , including the opening sequence , only altered in a humorous and superior way . \\na part of the cleverness comes from the cast . \\nsometimes a film with such talent is overblown , but the acting is what keeps it alive here . \\nwhile azaria and macy were enteratining , 2 characters really stood out . \\none was paul reuben . \\nno matter how disgusting or revolting \" mr . splein \" may be , you still can\\'t help but laugh . \\nit\\' so incredibly moronic , it\\'s just a riot watching reuben relieve himself of bodily functions . \\njaneane garafalo also was an interesting character . \\nshe seemed to be the most outgoing and convincing character on screem , due to her enthusiasm , that kept the film flowing . \\nmen is worth seeing alone , for those 2 troubled heroes . \\non the downside , a few of the heroes and especially the villain never really lift off . \\nkel mitchell and geoffrey rush , were both utterly useless . \\ntheir parts were so limited , they\\'d be lucky at all to be on screen for more than 20 minutes . \\nben stiller too was wasted , mostly because of his unlikeable power and dialogue . \\nnone of these characters get a rise out of anybody , but happily they are lost in the charming flow of the film . \\nas far as the budget goes , it was wisely spent on the cast , not the effects . \\nwhile the set designs and action all look nice , i\\'m glad there was a seperate aspect , that the film focused on , and for that i applaud . \\nslow at times , and rather pointless , mystery men still delivers . \\nit forgets about money making , because it\\'s not likely to make a bundle like it\\'s proceeders , and that\\'s what works . \\nstupid ? \\nmaybe , but for once i\\'m not disappointed . \\nno one expected an intelligent film , but you get a film thats wit captures your attention and makes you forget this miserable year . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" dangerous beauty \" is a really nothing more than a grandiose soap opera set in venice circa 1583 . \\nit is beautifully filmed , wonderfully acted , and certainly nothing short of entertaining , but it lacks any true fundamental seriousness . \\ndealing with themes of forbidden love , religious intolerance , subordination of women , sexual freedom , and the roles of pleasure and sin in a high-cultured society , it still feels like brightly lit fluff . \\nthe director , marshall herskovitz , doesn\\'t want to follow the dark and dangerous trail this story could lead down , so he opts for a more genial , livelier , and relatively shallow interpretation . \\nthe film takes place during the renaissance , a time when venice was the pleasure capital of europe . \\nat this time , venice was its own republic , and it thrived on being the central juncture of east-west commerce . \\nthe film is told almost entirely through the viewpoint of the aristocracy and the bourgeoisie of venice , so we rarely get to see how the rest of the society lived . \\nhowever , there is an abundance of detail concerning the lives and livelihoods of the upper classes , their hedonistic lifestyles and constant merriment . \\nthe story centers on veronica franco ( catherine mccormack ) , a lower class woman who falls in love with marco venier ( rufus sewell ) , the son of wealthy aristocratic parents ( jeroen krabb ? and joanna cassidy ) . \\nunfortunately , the culture of that time period did not view marriage as an act of love -- rather , it was more like a business transaction , where rich families married their sons and daughters to each other in order to secure power , wealth , and ensure that outsiders couldn\\'t get in . \\nveronica , despite her charm and good looks , is certainly an outsider . \\nafter a short love affair , marco breaks her heart with the news that he cannot marry her . \\nhowever , because she is beautiful and intelligent , veronica has a chance to enter marco\\'s world , albeit not as his wife . \\nshe decides to become a courtesan -- a class of women who were as well-educated as they were ravishing , and sold their sexuality to wealthy men for the privilege of wining and dining with the elite . \\na courtesan was not a mere prostitute ; they were afforded a special place in society , and they were greatly revered , respected , and often envied . \\nat one point , a character mentions that some rulers obtain more political advice from their courtesans than from their lieutenants . \\nveronica goes through the transformation with the help of her mother , paola ( jacqueline bisset ) , who was once a famed courtesan herself . \\nonce she enters the lifestyle , veronica finds that it suits her quite well . \\nshe is allowed to read all the books she wants , she is given the opportunity to publish her poetry , and she has the richest and most powerful men in the republic throwing themselves at her feet , including the awestruck marco . \\ntheir relationship develops into a playful bantering , with veronica utilizing her newfound power by constantly rejecting marco\\'s advances . \\nin many ways , their relationship is sad because marco is married to a women he is unable to love , and veronica is consumed by multiple relationships with men she is unwilling to love . \\n \" love the love , not the man , \" as her mother told her . \\n \" dangerous beauty , \" which was based on a factual book by margaret rosenthal , flows along as smoothly and serenely as the grand canal running through the heart of venice . \\nit has multiple plot lines -- including veronica\\'s adversarial relationship with a court poet ( oliver platt ) , her role in obtaining france\\'s military assistance in venice\\'s battle against the turks , and even the dreaded shadow of the plague and the encroachment of the spanish inquisition -- yet it is never confusing or overbearing . \\nmuch of the film\\'s success is due to the glowing performance by catherine mccormack in the lead role . \\nknown chiefly for the small part she played as the lover whose murder raised mel gibson\\'s ire in \" braveheart \" ( 1995 ) , mccormack shows the true gifts and inarguable talent of a leading lady . \\nshe has the kind of exquisite classical beauty that would be treasured in a courtesan ; her character is intelligent , witty , and both sensual and vulnerable , all of which mccormack easily transmits with a single flash of her eyes . \\nthe rest of the roles are also filled well , including rufus sewell whose performance here and earlier this month in \" dark city \" have assured him a solid place in hollywood . \\nhe has the same kind of unusual good looks and charm of ray liotta , and he seems perfectly at home in period dramas . \\noliver platt plays a variation of the comic relief role that he has come to inhabit like a second skin , although the film deals his character a cheap blow at the end by having him improbably join the inquisition and turn into the bad guy . \\nplatt is a good actor , but he\\'s just too hard to hate . \\njacqueline bisset proves that she is every bit as stirring as she ever was , and even fred ward turns up in a small , but moving performance as marco\\'s uncle . \\n \" dangerous beauty \" is marshall herskovitz\\'s sophomore directorial effort , after the overlooked 1993 film \" jack the bear . \" \\npartnered with edward zwick , herskovitz has spent most of his time as a producer on television ( \" thirtysomething , \" \" my so-called life \" ) and in the movies ( \" legends of the fall \" ) . \\nhis directing style can be best described as transparent -- it never gets in the way of the story , yet it has no discernible flourish or particular distinctions . \\nhe could have approached the film in any number of ways , including overdosing on the sexual aspect , which he wisely avoids . \\n \" dangerous beauty \" contains just enough bare flesh and ribald sex to make it appropriately erotic , but not so much that it seems exploitative . \\nherskovitz is also aided by a strong supporting crew , including the luscious photography by bojan bazelli , whose previous efforts include the highly-stylized thriller \" kalifornia \" ( 1993 ) and abel ferrara\\'s dark sci-fi film \" body snatchers \" ( 1994 ) . \\nbazelli captures the film in strong , bold colors , and be brings sixteenth-century venice to life in wide , panoramic shots that are often enhanced with digital imagery . \\nhowever , the real details are found in the production design by norman garwood ( \" brazil , \" \" the princess bride \" ) and the costumes by gabriella pescucci ( \" the age of innocence \" ) . \\nthe only problem with \" dangerous beauty \" is that it doesn\\'t stick with you . \\nit\\'s a good story well-told with interesting characters , but it\\'s easy to shrug off once you\\'ve left the theater . \\nthe only sequence that has the chance to be truly indelible is veronica being pulled in front of the hypocrisy of the inquisition and threatened with the death penalty for her transgressions , but it never quite comes off because it\\'s simply too melodramatic and conventional . \\nherskovitz tries with all his might to make it a nailbiter , but somehow its outcome is a foregone conclusion , and like the rest of the film , it carries no real weight , despite the potential severity of the subject matter . \\n',\n",
       " b'after seeing blaze and driving miss daisy , i was ready for some mindless fun--oh , maybe something like tango & cash . \\nmaybe not ! \\nmindless fun is one thing , but brain-dead slop is another matter altogether . \\ntango & cash has \" lowest common denominator \" written all over it . \\nthe movie stars sylvester stallone and kurt russell as rival undercover cops in l . a . russell plays cash , a reckless slob who dresses in jeans and tee shirts . \\nstallone plays tango , a wealthy investor who works on the force strictly for the thrill of it ; he doesn\\'t need the money . \\nin an effort to change his image , stallone goes for a yuppie , gq look in the film , wearing spectacles and three piece suits . \\nthe two detectives reluctantly become partners after they are framed for murder and have to break out of prison to clear their names . \\ntango & cash is unbearably noisy . \\nfor starters , there\\'s harold faltermeyer\\'s annoying synthesized score , which gets old after four notes . \\nto make matters worse , the filmmakers seem to think that when it comes to loud explosions and screeching cars , the more the merrier . \\nin fact , the movie begins with not one but two car chases . \\nthere\\'s nothing like a good old car chase to introduce the characters in a movie . \\nscreenwriter randy feldman\\'s brain must have gone to mush from watching too many cop shows on tv . \\nhis shockingly stupid screenplay undermines anything and everything the movie has going for it , such as stallone\\'s efforts to convince you that tango is an intellectual . \\nin a movie with the iq level of an amoeba , even a great actor is going to have trouble looking intelligent--and stallone is no lawrence olivier . \\nit\\'s hard to imagine anyone reading feldman\\'s script and thinking , \" i want to be in this movie . \" \\nthe film\\'s plot doesn\\'t have one original bone in its body , and--again--you have to point your finger at the screenwriting . \\nfeldman\\'s story line succumbs to every crime thriller cliche in the book , making tango & cash altogether generic and predictable . \\nthey simply could have called it \" action movie . \" \\nevery character , every twist and turn , is stolen from television or from other movies . \\nadding insult to injury , tango & cash is about as believable as a \" road runner \" cartoon . \\naction movies don\\'t have to be realistic , but they should absorb you enough so that you\\'re not thinking about the lack of realism . \\nthe only artistic aspect of tango & cash is the cinematography . \\nthere are some spectacular shots , especially during the rainy nighttime prison break in which tango and cash slide to safety on electrical wires . \\nthe film\\'s main draw is the chemistry between stallone and russell . \\nunfortunately , their relationship rarely progresses past macho competition as they endlessly bicker about who packs more meat in his pants . \\nthe dialogue consists of nothing but one-liners , and consequently the attempts at character development are embarrassing . \\nit\\'s a shame because with a workable screenplay , russell and stallone could have turned tango & cash into a charming \" lethal weaponesque \" adventure . \\ntango & cash tries to maintain a light tone , and you do laugh about once every five minutes . \\nseeing russell in drag is the movie\\'s funniest moment , but you probably already have seen it in the commercials . \\nfurthermore , the light tone does not sit well against the relentlessly brutal violence . \\nmachine guns and torture generally don\\'t mix well with comedy . \\njack palance appears in tango & cash doing what he does best : playing a sleazy , conniving villain . \\nhis character , however , is run-of-the-mill , except for his strange obsession with mice . \\nlike many movie villains , palance likes to play games . \\nin fact , he sets a ridiculously elaborate trap for tango and cash , a trap which sends the two detectives to prison so they can be beaten and electrocuted by some meanies in the boiler room . \\nyou have to wonder why palance doesn\\'t just shoot the detectives in the head ! \\nthe story would crumble if any of the characters were to do anything intelligent . \\nteri hatcher plays stallone\\'s sister and russell\\'s love-interest , and she is just as pretty as can be . \\nbut regrettably , hatcher\\'s acting is not on par with her exceptional beauty . \\nevery time she opens her mouth , you cringe ; corny dialogue and atrocious acting are always a fatal combination . \\nthere\\'s really very little , if anything , to recommend in the film . \\nand , more to the point , tango definitely isn\\'t worth a penny of your cash--so don\\'t bother . \\n',\n",

       " b'capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . \\njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . \\nit lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ?

' \\n-sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner ) , floyd ( winston bell ) . \\njamaican film , shot entirely on video , featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) . \\ncapone , a tough as nails super cop , gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him . \\nwhen he arrives , he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse , thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw ) , so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) . \\ncapone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and , much to his disappointment , also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him . \\ntorn between doing his job and protecting his best friend , capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again . \\ndirected deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct ) , one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while . \\nshots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films , although the action isn't as hyperkinetic as most of woo's films are . \\nthe action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though , and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) . \\nthe make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well , with flawless squib work on display from the effects team . \\nthe cast is superb and listening to their dialogue , spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang ) , just adds to the interest . \\npaul campbell , as the `loose cannon' capone , essays his role perfectly , displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times . \\nmark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty , the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together . \\nunfortunately , carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him ) , but then again , that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed . \\nthe music in the film is composed of all reggae songs , and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists , sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones , maxi priest , bob dylan , james brown , grace jones , herbie hancock , bootsy collins , and carly simon among others ) . \\nthe end credit song , `we run tings' , by the group red dragon , is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review . \\noddly enough , desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta' reggae as the performer ninjaman , and he doesn't contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see ) , which is virtually unheard of here in the us . \\nat the time of this writing , third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us , coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica , where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica , which is roughly $500 , 000 us ) . \\npalm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat , but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market , i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters . \\nchris blackwell , founder of palm pictures , was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman , so i'd say he has a pretty good track record . \\noverall , third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo , ringo lam , tsui hark , and many other action films by directors from hong kong . \\nif action films are your thing and you don't mind intermittent subtitles , then you can't go wrong with this film . \\nthe performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight . \\ni'm not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like , but apparently third world cop's honors are well deserved . \\n\",\n",

       " b'in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . \\nfull of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . \\ngo see it ! \\nso , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on \" hard copy \" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980\\'s . \\n \" hard copy \" \\'s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman\\'s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . \\nsmart replied that she thought kidman\\'s character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . \\n ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) \\nsmart\\'s got a point . \\nit wouldn\\'t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . \\nhowever , given a choice between the mass media \\'happening\\' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . \\nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \\nto die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \\nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being \\'on tv . \\' \\nof course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \\nbut , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . \\nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . \\ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . \\nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . \\nkidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . \\nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \\nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \\n \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" \\nher husband beams at suzanne\\'s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . \\nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . \\nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . \\nhe plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne\\'s sexual favors . \\nkidman\\'s character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . \\nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . \\nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain\\'t going anywhere , ever . \\nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . \\ngus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . \\nhe keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . \\nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn\\'t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . \\nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to \\'get it\\' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . \\nthe screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i\\'ve heard since heathers . \\nhenry\\'s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . \\nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . \\ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy

       " b\"keep cool , a chinese film directed by semi-accomplished filmmaker yimou zhang , was one of the kickoff films for this year's hawaii international film festival . \\non the day it premiered , lines of eager moviegoers stretched around the block , some anticipants having queued up well in advance to get a good seat in the theater . \\nthey need not have wasted their time . \\nthe movie is billed as a comedy , but is surprisingly bereft of humor . \\nthere are noticeable attempts at laughs , but very few tries actually click . \\ni wondered if there were jokes that i wasn't getting because i'm not from china , but unfortunately my conclusion was that this lack of humor couldn't be attributed to the cultural barrier either . \\nkeep cool just isn't very funny . \\nthe prelude to the film was a visit by keep cool's producer who , with the help of an interpreter , regaled us of how in order to get the print to the festival in time , an assistant hand carried it on the plane from china to hawaii . \\nalthough the print made it , the assistant's luggage was lost . \\ntoo bad that story wasn't in the movie , because it got a big laugh . \\nqu ying , the film's female lead , was also on hand to give a few comments . \\nhowever , whereas the producer politely made regular pauses in his dialog so the interpreter could bring us up to speed , ms . ying saw fit to say everything she had to say in one , fast-paced , incredibly long tirade . \\nit was dizzying ; good foreshadowing for the film . \\nyou see , keep cool is filmed almost totally with a camera handheld by a man with a bad case of the shakes . \\nat least that's the way it seems , since the camera is constantly moving . \\ncinema verite is one thing , but panning and shaking around until your audience has a headache is another . \\nalthough some might consider it a form which helps give the viewer an idea of the anarchic state into which chinese youth is slowly growing , i found it thoroughly distracting , and after a while , quite annoying . \\nheadache , as i said . \\nthe film is about a young bookseller ( wen jiang ) who is after a young woman ( qu ying ) . \\nthey used to be romantically involved , but the woman grew tired of him and left the relationship . \\nthe first half of the film is about the young man's plan to win her back . \\nof course the thing is , she doesn't want to be won back , and has a nightclub owner friend of hers rough him up a bit . \\nin the fight , the young man grabs a laptop computer belonging to a bystander and attempts to use it to fend off his attacker , but only ends up smashing it against a lamppost . \\nwe later find out that the laptop belongs to an older man who wishes to get his damaged computer replaced . \\nthere is a funny scene ( the only one in the film ) where the young man tries to use some twisted logic in order to get the older man to seek out the nightclub owner ( baotian li ) in order to recoup his losses . \\nthere is no sense to be made out of the young woman's behavior ; cold one minute , caring the next , so we feel no sympathy for her character . \\nthe bookseller would be better off without her . \\nalthough the second half of the film causes us to lose a lot of sympathy for the young bookseller as well , who is obsessed with chopping off the nightclub owner's hand as revenge for the beating he took , it also offers us some nice interaction between the bookseller and the older man . \\nwhile the bookseller is blinded by his thirst for revenge , the older man is the voice of reason and tries to rationalize each situation . \\nhis quest to end the dispute peacefully and equitably is the one we identify with , but it is frustrating to see that he seems to be talking to a brick wall half the time . \\na friendship develops between the two men , but it occurs too late in the film for the audience to appreciate . \\nalthough only an hour and a half in length , keep cool contains extraneous material . \\nthe whole plot of how the bookseller is after the young woman could have been taken out , since we don't see her from the midpoint on . \\na case of mistaken identity or some other device could have served as the point of conflict between the bookseller and the nightclub owner , and would have saved us from the bookseller's boring pursuit during the first half . \\nbut of course , this would have shortened the movie to less than an hour . \\nthere are a few things that keep cool does right . \\nas mentioned before , the interaction between the bookseller and the older man is generally pretty good . \\nalthough it grows tiresome , the reasoning with the unreasonable is a nice exercise in logic , and represents the differences in thinking between generations . \\nin one scene , for example , the bookseller quotes confucius to get his point across , but the older man claims the quote was misinterpreted , and that it means something entirely different . \\nalso effective is the way zhang sets up tension within a scene , such as when the bookseller is getting ready to cut off the hand of the unwitting nightclub owner . \\nthe nightclub owner is counting out money , slapping each bundle of currency on the table . \\nwith every shot of his hand , we can hardly stand the interminable wait before the bookseller is going to pull out his cleaver and exact his revenge . \\nunfortunately , these crumbs are not enough to overcome the rest of the film's shortcomings , and weren't enough to prevent that headache from lingering after i left the theater . \\n\",\n",

       " b'playwright tom stoppard and screenwriter marc norman took on an astonishingly difficult task : they wanted to write a script about william shakespeare that parallels shakespeare\\'s works . \\nthey also wanted to poke fun at the way all of us envision shakespeare : i mean , really , who doesn\\'t think of shakespeare as a guy seething with so much passion that he can barely write a play without exploding into a passionate , introspective verbal couplet of iambic pentameter ? \\nstoppard and norman are men who love shakespeare , and they wanted to make a movie for everyone else who loves shakespeare . \\nand , despite the difficulty of their task , they have succeeded . \\nshakespeare in love is one of the smartest , funniest , most touching films of the year . \\nit\\'s so rare that a picture with such high aspirations succeeds in all of its endeavors , but here we have a movie that defines success : it is at once charmingly acted and flawlessly written . \\nit could have been a smug , self-important movie that panders to die-hard shakespeare fans , but the appeal of this film is almost universal : if you\\'ve ever read a play by shakespeare , or know anything about his life , it\\'s likely that you\\'ll find grand entertainment in shakespeare in love . \\njoseph fiennes , brother of ralph , stars as shakespeare himself ; he\\'s a delightful , irresistible lad , concerned mostly with women and detached from life\\'s more serious problems ( debt , plague , etc . ) . \\nhe\\'s commissioned to write plays for various people : queen elizabeth ( judi dench ) wants comedies , while local slimeball philip henslowe ( geoffrey rush ) needs him to write a play so that he can pay off his debts to hugh fennymann ( tom wilkinson ) . \\nshakespeare , however , has trouble focusing on his work . \\nhe begins work on a comedy about a boy named romeo and a girl named ethel . \\nthis all changes , however , when he meets viola de lesseps ( a radiant gwyneth paltrow ) , a young heiress set to marry the financially-oriented lord wessex ( colin firth ) . \\nshakespeare instantly falls in love with her ; he first meets her when she pretends to be a man to try out for the part of romeo . \\nhe discovers her identity and confronts her later ; she , of course , falls in love with him , although their love is doomed because she absolutely must marry the tyrannical lord wessex . \\nbut she continues to act because she loves shakespeare\\'s writing so much , and soon the production ( which later becomes romeo and juliet ) is set to be performed . \\nshakespeare in love is an amazingly good film , not because it works as great entertainment , but because it pays attention to detail and knows its subject matter . \\ni was instantly won over by joseph fiennes in the lead role : he has such searing optimism and energy ; he\\'s clearly a man who admires shakespeare , and even in the shortcomings that he gives his character ( inability to turn away from women , attention deficit disorder ) , we sense a great deal of affection and care . \\nhe practically overflows with passion in every scene . \\nfiennes is matched by paltrow ( whose english accent is so good that wonder where she actually comes from ) ; she is an actress who exudes strength and conviction in every performance i\\'ve seen her in . \\nthe two performers work perfectly together , taking the passionate scenes as far as possible without making them melodramatic , and wringing the comedic scenes for every conceivable laugh . \\nof course , it doesn\\'t hurt that they have a masterful script to work with . \\nstoppard , whose play rozencrantz and guildenstern are dead inspired an interesting film , is full of dry wit and boundless understated humor ( all of his plays have similarly dry humor ) . \\nthe first intelligent step stoppard and norman took was harmonizing the events of the film with romeo and juliet . \\none of the funniest scenes in the film is an imitation of the famous terrace scene from the play ; in the movie , shakespeare is bumbling about while viola is trying to fend off her nurse maid . \\ndirector john madden does a fantastic job dabbling in slapstick humor -- scenes like these would have seemed obtuse in the hands of a lesser director . \\ni\\'m going to have to see the movie again ; i\\'m certain there are numerous references that i missed . \\nin fact , i doubt it\\'s possible to gather everything with just one viewing . \\nstoppard is a master of detail : you\\'ll notice familiar lines placed throughout the film , not as lines of a play , but as dialogue , suggesting that shakespeare simply spoke like that all the time . \\nthere\\'s also a brilliant running joke in which shakespeare is in constant competition with christopher marlowe ( and the fact that marlowe is played by the openly-homosexual rupert everett is a joke in of itself ) , proposing a slightly twisted explanation to marlowe\\'s mysterious death in a pub . \\nthere\\'s also a scene featuring a wide-eyed dog that is so funny that i hurt myself laughing . \\n \" there\\'s no dog in this play ? \" \\n \" no ! \\nno dog ! \" \\nthe ensemble cast is perhaps the strongest this year . \\ngeoffrey rush is nearly unrecognizable as the detestable henslowe ; wilkinson is also hard to recognize , but has a great role as a thug who takes his part as the apothecary so seriously . \\nben affleck , playing one of the actors in the company , shows great range , both in his accent ( his is almost as good as paltrow\\'s ) and in humor ( he has some of the best one-liners in the movie ) . \\ncolin firth , always stuck playing the sap , does a good job being hateful . \\njudi dench , however , has the best supporting performance as queen elizabeth : rarely has so much depth been conveyed in so few words . \\nmy single , minor complaint about shakespeare in love is that i feel like i could have been more moved by the end . \\nthe story is moving , but there are a few missed opportunities in the final scenes . \\nbut my quibbling is not important . \\nwhat is important is that i acknowledge the quality of this picture , the sheer skill with which it has been written , acted , and produced . \\nshakespeare in love tries so many things , and nails every one of them : it\\'s a film that both loves shakespeare and makes fun of him , a film in which the actors , writers , and director are all perfectly in sync . \\nit\\'s also a movie that has the potential to introduce a lot of people to shakespeare\\'s work in a positive way , without seeming condescending or superior . \\ni admire this film not only because it passes so pleasantly , but because it has lofty aspirations and succeeds in them . \\nnot just any film can poke fun at shakespeare and get away with it . \\n',\n",

       " b'paul verhoeven , the dutch auteur who dragged his violent , sexually aggressive aesthetic into american film , has never been what i\\'d consider a thoughtful director ( though some of his films , notably starship troopers , have been lauded as artistic achievements ) , but he is the kind of hollywood film maker who\\'s managed to , no matter what the budget , make his films distinctive and even sometimes smuggle stimulating themes into the lavish high concepts on which he toils . \\nstarship troopers was essentially a b-monster movie remake of his enthralling dutch war film soldier of orange ( a great film that\\'s nearly impossible to find on video , yet showgirls is everywhere ) , in which he cast a troop of stunningly attractive mannequins ; the square jawed casper van dien and denise richards ( who may actually be 45% silicone ) , in what feels like an american propaganda picture set to monotonous scenes of graphic carnage . \\nit\\'s not a completely successful film , but as a failure it\\'s certainly an interesting ( and mostly entertaining ) one . \\nmy favorite verhoeven films were the ones he made before he hit our shores ; spetters , a dark near pornographic coming of age film set within the sub-culture of drag racing and the aforementioned soldier of orange ( haven\\'t yet gotten around to seeing the 4th man or turkish delight ) . \\ni believe his best hollywood film to be robocop , a bleak super-hero satire with a robotic hero that\\'s as touching as schwarzenegger\\'s in t2 . \\nthat movie was violent but not in the overdone cartoonish manner of more recent verhoeven pics . \\nits violence seemed to be there for a purpose , namely to create an atmosphere of unpredictable dread , not to simply titillate an attention deprived audience . \\nthere\\'s a jaw-dropping scene within the first ten minutes of robocop wherein the lead villain toys with a cop before snuffing him . \\nhe tortures the officer by taking glee in his victim\\'s every fearful tic . \\nit\\'s a startling moment of barbaric , maddening violence that effectively sets the tone for the film that could be designated as splatter punk-noir . \\nin hollow man kevin bacon brutally slays a dog because it just won\\'t shut up , he impales a co-worker , drowns another and so on . \\nbut why ? \\nhis character is introduced as a smug genius , the kind who\\'s always impeccably dressed and races a sports car while generic rock tunes blare from his stereo for the world to hear , sort of like a scheming uber villain from dallas or melrose place , though once the character becomes invisible , this film has him pull a 180 shift into a psychotic movie monster . \\nthe kind who just won\\'t die . \\nhollow man\\'s protagonists are the completely bland but beautiful scientist linda ( elizabeth shue , acting as if she were rebecca of sunnybrook farm ) and her lover , a hunk of beef scientist played by josh brolin who\\'s saddled with the film\\'s worst lines ( \" i\\'ve lost cohesion again ! \" ) . \\nthey\\'re a typical aaron spelling couple , good-looking but as vacant as george w . bush\\'s republican national convention speech ( i . e . \\nbush referring to clinton ; \" ?

\\na couple weeks ago , after seeing the trailer , a bunch of friends and i got into a long discussion of how invisible man flicks never go so far as to have the invisible individual indulging in their newfound ability . \\nhollow man looked like the first film to do so and whoa , in a serious manner to boot . \\nbut oh yeah , it is directed by paul verhoven not atom egoyan or peter greenway . \\nverhoeven delivers the sleazy \" goods \" , but not in a watchable or thrillingly disturbing manner , here it just feels icky and uncomfortable . \\nthe director keeps his camera trained at his nubile actresses , caressing their breasts with his lens all while faux-psycho music strains in the background . \\nit\\'s plainly obvious that verhoeven isn\\'t exploring voyeurism ( like in the classic peeping tom ) but exploiting it and not even doing that very well . \\nit\\'s funny that with all the technology $90 million can get you verhoven is stuck at trying to figure out how to show a woman\\'s naked breast manipulated by an invisible hand . \\nmost vexing is that the invisibility aspect is used simply as gimmick in yet another slasher movie wherein characters do stupid things just so the villain can pop up for more attacks . \\nin fact it\\'s largely irrelevant that bacon is invisible since , by the end , most of his potential victims don infer-red glasses that track his body heat . \\nas in every mad slasher film we get the killers pov ( a scene where he spies on his neighbor while she undresses triggered unpleasant memories of slumber party massacre ) , and lots of scenes where people are unknowingly stalked . \\nthe film only provides one moment that i found genuinely creepy . \\nit happens when a lab assistant ( kim dickens , who looks like she stepped out of playboy ) in the middle of a chit chat with an invisible bacon , suddenly pauses . \\n \" are you looking at me ?

       " b'assume nothing . \\nthe phrase is perhaps one of the most used of the 1990\\'s , as first impressions and rumors are hardly ever what they seem to be . \\nthe phrase especially goes for oscar novak , an architect who is the main focus of three to tango , a delightful , funny romantic comedy about assumptions and being yourself . \\nnovak ( matthew perry ) , a shy , clumsy , chicago based architect , along with openly gay partner , peter steinberg ( oliver platt ) , fights for projects day in and day out . \\none of these is the job of restoring a popular building for charles newman ( dylan mcdermott ) , a rich , well-known businessman . \\ncharles immediately takes a liking to oscar , as he enjoys his personality and sense of humor . \\nseeing oscar as someone he could trust , charles asks him to watch his girlfriend , an unpredictable , adventurous girl named amy post ( neve campbell ) , who makes a living by blowing glass . \\ncharles wants to know who she talks to , what she does , and where she goes . \\nthe point ? \\nto make sure she\\'s not seeing someone else , of course . \\noscar gladly takes the job , and meets amy at an art show of hers , and sparks fly between the two from the get go . \\noscar feels he has found the one meant for him , and he is content with the idea of being with amy . \\nwell , another popular phrase of the 90\\'s is \" all good things must come to an end , \" and this stays true for oscar as well . \\ncharles walks in on amy and oscar having a drink one night , as oscar and amy have become great friends , but he doesn\\'t seem to mind . \\nwhy is this ? \\nhe thinks oscar is gay . \\nhe\\'s not afraid to share this with him either . \\noscar stands in shock after the words , \" i swear if you weren\\'t gay oscar , i\\'d have to kill you , \" are muttered flamboyantly from charles\\' mouth . \\nthe word spreads instantly through town . \\nwill oscar \" come out \" of his supposed gayness , or will he tell everyone that he isn\\'t ? \\none would immediately think he would deny the fact , but numerous occurrences come to oscar , which result in the fact that if he denies the fact , he could lose his job with charles . \\nmatthew perry doesn\\'t escape his character as chandler on the already classic t . v . \\ncomedy \" friends , \" as both oscar novak and chandler are clueless , shy , and sensitive . \\nnonetheless , perry is hilarious here , and shows that he can handle drama , as obviously , his character suffers quite a bit here . \\nit\\'s wonderful to see neve campbell outside of a horror movie , ( she was the star of scream 1 and 2 , and the upcoming scream 3 ) as she handles comedy superbly here . \\nher voice , smile , and personality are more than perfect for romantic comedies- stay with this genre , neve . \\nneve is delightful as her conflicted character , who feels love for oscar , but knows , based on rumors , that he is gay . \\nas usual , campbell is likable as her likable character . \\nunlike the other two leads here , dylan mcdermott is flat in his dialogue , and is never convincing . \\nwhen his character his present , mcdermott sets a dull tone to the scene with his horrible acting . \\nstick to the t . v . \\ndrama , the practice , dylan . \\nthe major weak spot in three to tango is the direction of damon santostefano . \\nno originality or technique is used whatsoever . \\nthree to tango is lucky that the script is so edgy and that perry and campbell are wonderful in comedy , or else the film would have been a disaster , as it is just plain boring to look at . \\nthree to tango is a film done many times before , as the plot is suspiciously close to 1998\\'s the object of my affection , but the plot has never been completed so well . \\nthree to tango\\'s script , written by rodney patrick vaccaro and aline brosh mckenna is fun , fast , and funny , delivering not only original , hilarious gay jokes ( not your run of the mill material ) , but a certain snappiness in the dialogue between characters that always keeps you smiling . \\nunlike last summer\\'s south park : bigger , longer , and uncut and 1997\\'s in & out , three to tango is a comedy in which the gay element is not crude or vulgar . \\nthe script is wise to take this route , as gays can\\'t ( i don\\'t think so , anyway ) be offended by this light , playful comedy . \\n ( to prove this , a gay couple was in the audience who were laughing constantly . ) \\nthree to tango\\'s climax is a hilarious , clever scene that is pure irony based on the outcome of most romantic-mistaken identity comedies . \\nthree to tango is a gem . \\nthe bottom line : three to tango is a light , sharp , snappy romantic comedy with a superb ending , and great stars . \\none of the better romantic comedies of 1999 . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" gattaca \" represents a solid breakthrough in the recent onslaught of science-fiction films -- it\\'s a genre picture that doesn\\'t rely on alien creatures or loud explosions to tell its story . \\nthe movie takes place in a futuristic world where babies are created through genetic tampering and not sexual reproduction . \\nthis allows parents to predetermine what kind of eye color , intelligence and life span they\\'d like for their child , and also eliminates most pesky chances of health defects . \\nthose made the old-fashioned way are labeled as \" in-valids \" and confined to the lower rung of society . \\nvincent freeman ( ethan hawke ) is one such person , born not too long before the genetic process was perfected and forced to grow up in a home with his petrie dish-molded younger brother anton . \\nfed up with being second-rate and enchanted by dreams of one day traveling through space , vincent leaves home and takes a janitorial position at the gattaca aerospace corporation . \\neveryday , he watches as \" superior \" folk make his fantasy a reality . \\ndetermined to do the same , vincent meets a dna broker ( tony shalhoub in a funny cameo ) who sells fake identities to in-valids . \\nhis counterpart for this scam is jerome morrow ( jude law ) , an ex-athlete left paralyzed in an accident and confined to a wheelchair for life . \\nfor a price and the promise of a caretaker , jerome supplies vincent with his identity , as well as blood , skin and urine samples for all of those pesky on-the-job tests and physical examinations -- this future is one where employees clock in by pricking their fingers instead of punching a time card . \\nbecause of his drastically improved status , vincent is quickly propelled to a high position in gattaca , and catches the eye of comely co-worker irene ( uma thurman ) on the way -- obsessed with her own minor heart defect , she\\'s enamored by his flawless persona she doesn\\'t know is a lie . \\nbut on the figurative eve of his upcoming planetary departure , the mission director is murdered . \\ntwo ardent detectives ( alan arkin and billy bathgate\\'s loren dean ) determine the killer is on the inside of gattaca , and the sole clue they find at the crime scene -- one of vincent\\'s eyelashes -- threatens to blow vincent\\'s cover and derail his goal . \\neven if \" gattaca \" were dramatically empty , it would still boast a sublime set of production credentials -- the film\\'s look is dazzling without ever being flashy . \\nfirst-time director/writer andrew niccol ( he also wrote the screenplay for the upcoming jim carrey drama \" the truman show \" ) demonstrates a keen eye for the stylish ; his collaboration with cinematographer slawomir idziak , production designer jan roelfs and costume designer colleen atwood result in a sophisticated composition that emanates classy , retro ambiance . \\nan opening credits sequence -- where skin , nail and hair fragments fall in slow-motion through a colored camera lens -- displays these combined talents uncannily . \\nniccol even utilizes voice-over narration ( a device almost always poorly-employed ) in an effective way . \\nwhen it comes to acting , the movie is also flawless . \\nethan hawke does magnificent work , proving his ability to carry a film and reaffirming his enormously high charisma level . \\nhis chemistry with thurman is a bit on the icy side , but needfully so , adding to the setting\\'s clinical chill . \\nas the bitter jerome , jude law has a star-making presence , and it\\'s his scenes with hawke that give the movie its fine emotional core . \\nin \" gattaca \" \\'s series of final shots , the fates of vincent and jerome are superimposed over each other , and the effect is sad , lyrical and beautiful . \\nthings get a little strange as the movie nears its climax , when vincent\\'s relationship with his brother comes back into view . \\nthe big dramatic culmination is a swim race , which is somewhat silly albeit beautifully photographed . \\nstill , the single most surprising aspect of gattaca is its use of backdrop -- it\\'s successful sci-fi without showy special effects , it\\'s a crisp thriller with character-driven thrills , it\\'s a futuristic fable without blood and guts . \\neven its murder mystery is relegated to a secondary subplot , ensuring that a smart story about smart people and smart science takes center stage . \\nalthough it\\'s portrayal of the upcoming century is grim , \" gattaca \" serves up one of the most thought-provoking societal forecasts ever depicted on film . \\n',\n",
       " b'ladies and gentlemen , 1997\\'s independence day is here ! \\nit\\'s title : starship troopers . \\nand surprisingly , it is more entertaining than id4 . \\ni realize that i gave last year\\'s sci-fi hit a 4 star rating , but i was under the spell of the powerful first hour . \\nafter subsequent viewings , i feel that independence day really wasn\\'t as great as it seemed--though i still give it a positive review . \\nstarship troopers , on the other hand , has a mocking sense of humor , knowing perfectly well how ridiculous it may seem . \\nas a result , starship troopers is a more exciting , energetic , and lively science fiction film . \\nin fact , i probably could never get tired of watching this film . \\nstarship troopers is very reminiscient of star wars , another kick-ass space opera which reinvented the sci-fi drama altogether . \\nwhile starship troopers is no star wars , it comes quite close , and the easiest assessment would be to call this film : \" the \\'star wars\\' of the 90s . \" \\nam i being to generous to this film ? \\nperhaps , but when a science fiction film comes along that can mix humor and romance , effectively , into the warring races . \\nin essence , this is the science fiction equivolence of pulp fiction . \\nthe easiest way to write a review of this film would be to compare it to other science fiction films , and i may have to . \\nstarship troopers is not quite an original film persay , but director paul verhoeven gives the film a \" kick-the-aliens\\'-asses \" style . \\nid4 had this same style , except it was forced , most likely the cause of will smith having a major role . \\nthis new \" star wars \" has a very simple , basic plot : mankind vs . an alien species . \\nthe alien species in question here is the bugs , a seemingly advanced civilization of arachnid-type insects . \\nhowever , the underlying morals of starship troopers are fleshed out with deadly accuracy . \\nsometimes the morals are buried by the bloody violence and intense action scenes , but during quiet moments , we realize that starship troopers has something to tell us about our civilization . \\nmore than likely , these morals will be overpowered and quickly forgotten by the time the movie ends . \\nand they should be . \\ni doubt verhoeven intended this film to be a thought-provoking film . \\nthis is an \" event \" film , but surprisingly above average . \\nit is extremely refreshing to watch a sci-fi war film , and actually root for the human side ( something independence day never achieved ) . \\nstarship troopers begins with a satirical portrayal of those strange \" join the army \" ads . \\nmixing a web-based interface , these summations of events are refreshingly original . \\nstating , \" would you like to know more ? \" , \\nthese short news bulletins give the film an immediate sense of humor , and we know we should not take it seriously . \\nhowever , we also witness the murder of several troopers in battle , in a gory , yet funny , way . \\nafter witnessing the slaughter , the film jumps back one year , to setup what we just saw . \\nwe are introduced to johnny rico ( casper van dien ) and carmen ibanez ( denise richards ) . \\nrico flirts with carmen by sending her messages over computer terminals in school classrooms . \\nhowever , carmen isn\\'t as interested in rico as she is in becoming a pilot . \\nhowever , another classmate , dizzy flores ( dina meyer ) , has her eye on rico . \\nunfortunately , rico isn\\'t interested in dizzy . \\nthis setup is rather cliched , as is the result of the setup , but it still is fun to watch . \\ncarmen signs up to become a starship trooper , and as a result , rico signs up . \\nand as a result , dizzy signs up . \\neveryone is assigned a certain position in the academy : carmen gets the pilot position she wanted , carl jenkins ( neil patrick harris ) , a psychic , gets a position in the training program , and rico is left in the lowest class of the starship troopers : the mobile infantry . \\nthe main story follows rico through his trials and relationships . \\nin reality , i found myself watching a space version of \" melrose place , \" but with better special effects . \\nan hour into the film , the war begins . \\na sense of tension grew in the audience i watched this film with . \\nthe first hour may have been a funny ( sometimes unintentionally ) setup , but we grew to care for the flat characters , because no matter how hard i tried not to like the characters , their gorgeous looks won me over ( call me superficial , if you must ) . \\nfollowing the training sessions , which had many dramas in themselves ( too many to mention here ) , the troopers are sent to war . \\nthe bugs live on the planet klendathu , a planet which consists of dirt and rock , and pretty much nothing else . \\nmany dramas occur during the war , until finally the troopers realize that their is something behind the bugs\\' attacks . \\na sort of intelligence which masterminds the defense . \\nthe troopers are ordered to locate the \" brain \" and capture it . \\ni hopefully left the plot as vague as possible , because starship troopers is not about plot . \\nit\\'s about special effects and gory violence . \\ndirector verhoeven , most known for his nudie film showgirls and basic instinct , returns to his sci-fi days , which gave us good films like total recall . \\nverhoeven likes to push the envelope of the mpaa , but despite all the violence , the comic book feel gives the film a sense of falsehood . \\nstarship troopers is extremely violent , with more gore than this year\\'s event horizon . \\nthe r rating is well deserved , and hopefully parents will not allow their 12 year old children to see it . \\nmy guess is that verhoeven\\'s target audience is the 18 to 25 male group . \\nthe film has a testosterone level off the charts , with chiseled men and beautiful women . \\ndespite these superficial elements , starship troopers also creates a world which made star wars so successful . \\nwhile watching the film , we never second guess the character\\'s decisions because they seem perfectly clear . \\nthankfully , no hero is punching aliens in the face , which gives the flat characters some depth for which we can identify with . \\nthe cast of starship troopers is quite annoying to begin with , but they soon grow on you . \\ncasper van dien has the chiseled facial features and tan skin which will make most girls swoon . \\nto most guys , he will come across as artificial . \\nfortunately , van dien is the worst of the cast , despite how hard he tries to come off as a real character . \\ndina meyer does a much better job of fleshing out her character . \\nher dizzy is extremely likeable . \\ndenise richards also does a good job , and her scenes are very well done . \\njake busey , gary busey\\'s son , gives a wonderfully funny performance , and provides one of the biggest laughs of the film . \\nneil patrick harris ( remember , he was doogie howser ) is a little wooden , and slightly out of place with the rest of the cast . \\nhowever , he does give a good performance . \\nmichael ironside gives the best performance of the film as the teacher with one arm . \\nhis performance rises above the rest . \\nperhaps it is because his character is the most developed , but i think it is just ironside\\'s presence on screen . \\nunfortunately , no particular cast member gives a star-making performance , which is too bad because the material here could have made many of the cast members stars . \\ndirector verhoeven is the main star of the film . \\nhis direction is fast and unrelentless . \\nhe never slows down his pace , which makes for a wild ride . \\nwriter edward neumeier adapted the screenplay from the book by robert heinlein . \\nthe writing is usually very funny , and sometimes very corny . \\nthe dialogue is smart but not too smart . \\nwe aren\\'t required to know everything , but some plot holes are left unanswered . \\nthankfully we are not intended to notice , and we really don\\'t ( except for one which lingered in my mind for quite a while ) . \\namazingly , with all the wars and romance going on , the screenplay manages to include some surprising governmental issues . \\nin fact , these governmental changes seem fairly plausible , and this adds another layer to the story . \\nthe moral debate of the characters is quite surprising to find in a film of this genre , but what is even more surprising is the amount of humor included into all the carnage . \\ni haven\\'t laughed this loud , even in some comedies . \\noh , and the special effects are first rate . \\nstarship troopers is rated r for graphic sci-fi violence and gore , and for some language and nudity . \\nbelieve me when i say this : don\\'t take young kids to see this film . \\nit is extremely violent . \\nin fact , it is probably the most violent film out this year . \\nhowever , if you are old enough ( over 17 ) to see it , starship troopers is guaranteed to entertain . \\nit\\'s been a long time since i have cheered for the heros , while also cheering for the bad guys . \\nand still , it is my dream to see a sci-fi film in which the alien race destroys mankind , and take over the world . \\nnow that would be entertaining ! \\n',\n",
       " b'star wars : episode 1 - the phantom menace ( 1999 ) \\nreview by matt pusateri \\nfew movies evoke nostalgia , enthusiasm , and affection like george lucas\\' 1977 classic , star wars . \\nthe original blockbuster film and its two sequels not only evoked wonder and passion in a generation of filmgoers , but has deeply entrenched itself in american pop culture . \\narguably , more americans today can explain what \" the force \" or a \" jedi \" is than a budget deficit or a serb . \\nso 22 years after the release of the original , and 16 years since the third film , the return of the jedi , how can any new star wars film withstand the weight of incomparable expectations and anticipation ? \\ncan a new storyline and a new cast of characters possibly compete with the legends of the first trilogy - luke , han solo , and darth vader -all cultural icons ? \\nagainst this challenge , the fourth star wars film , episode one : the phantom menace hit the screens last week . \\nand despite some early critical reviews in the major media , the film is neither a flop nor a disappointment . \\nwhile the phantom menace is certainly not the finest film in the series , it is nonetheless engaging , exciting , and visually breathtaking . \\nit is a worthy sequel - er , prequel - to the original star wars films . \\nthe phantom menace takes place decades before the setting of original films . \\nas the film opens , obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) , the wise old master who introduced luke to the force in the original star wars , is only a young jedi apprentice , still learning from his fellow jedi and instructor , qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) . \\nthe republic government has sent the two jedi to settle a trade dispute that has developed into a blockade of the planet naboo by a shifty trade federation . \\nthe jedi quickly find themselves not in negotiations , but in the middle of a planetary invasion , rushing to protect naboo\\'s young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) . \\nlater , after eventually rescuing amidala and helping her escape naboo , they are forced to stop at tatooine to repair their battle-damaged ship before bringing her to the galactic senate to make an appeal for justice . \\non tatooine , qui-gon discovers a young slave boy , anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) , who not only can help them get the parts they need , but displays uncanny intelligence , insight , and instincts . \\nqui-gon senses the child is \" unusually strong \" with the force and begins to suspect that he may be \" the one \" prophesized to \" bring balance to the force . \" \\nas anyone who has watched the original star wars trilogy knows , far from being a galactic savior , the innocent-looking 9-year-old will in time become the ruthless darth vader . \\ncomplicating matters further is a mysterious hooded figure , darth sidious , is behind the trade blockade and invasion of naboo , and sends out a lethal apprentice , darth maul , to find and capture queen amidala . \\nwhile amidala and the jedi fight to save her planet , they soon also have to deal with the deadly and relentless darth maul . \\nif the plot sounds a bit complicated , it is . \\nthe phantom menace not only introduces an earlier generation of characters and an immediate crisis , but sets up the foundation for the events that will eventually lead to the fall of the republic , the demise of the jedi knights , anakin\\'s turn to evil , and the rise of the dark empire of original trilogy . \\nbut the complexity is not overwhelming . \\nthe story moves quickly , with the only drawback being that many questions , predictably , remain unanswered at the end of the film , setting the stage for the next episode . \\none of the reasons the film\\'s story seems hazy is not that it is too confusing , but too unfocused . \\nit\\'s unclear whose story phantom menace is . \\nin the original trilogy , the movies were clearly luke\\'s story , with the stories centering around his growth from farmboy to rebel hero to jedi knight . \\nbut it\\'s unclear whether this new film is anakin\\'s story or obi-wan\\'s . \\nif this trilogy is centered on anakin , it\\'s a shaky foundation . \\nlloyd , like many child actors , lacks the subtle acting skills of adult performers , and as a result , his character seems shallow and unimpressive . \\non screen , we see nothing that suggests a dark side lurking underneath his little-boy face , or for that matter , any presence that would make him seem so special that qui-gon is willing to believe he is \" the one . \" \\nthe rest of the cast does fine , though they often work with some iffy dialogue by lucas . \\nneeson is perfect as an aging jedi knight . \\nmcgregor is well-cast as obi-wan and conveys a balance of youthful energy and calm sensibility . \\nportman fits the role of a young queen well , but her lines were often very formal , giving her little room to give her character much personality . \\nthe biggest problem with the phantom menace is not the plot or the characters , but the interaction between them . \\nindividually , the characters in this new film are no less developed than those in the original star wars , and the storyline is not more confusing than previous films in the series . \\nbut unlike the previous trilogy , lucas doesn\\'t do as good of a job playing the characters off one another . \\nin star wars , there were immediate contrasts and memorable exchanges between luke and han , han and obi-wan , and leia and luke . \\nthe ensemble played off each other and immediately showed their distinct attitudes and personalities . \\nin the sequence in where luke , han , and chewbacca attempt to rescue leia from her cell on the death star , the audience learns a lot about all four characters in the ways they react to the immediate problems and each other . \\nthere is no comparable sequence in the phantom menace to flesh out the characters and their relationships with each other . \\nindividually , they are interesting characters with clear motivations and interests , but lucas develops little chemistry or tension between the them . \\nthis is perhaps the most glaring weakness of this film , and is probably the reason it has disappointed many reviewers . \\nbut despite the need for a richer dialogue and stronger character interaction , the film is still very engaging . \\nmany of the wonderful elements of lucas\\' previous films make the phantom menace both memorable and entertaining . \\nfirst , of course , is the remarkably rich and imaginative universe lucas creates . \\nthe characters visit magical underwater cities , evade dinosaur-sized sea monsters , fight battle droids and menacing \" destroyers \" on venetian-looking planet of naboo , watch a spectacular event , part roman-chariot race , part nascar circuit , on the arid desert planet of tatooine , then head to corsucant , the gothic urban capital of the republic and home to the galactic senate and the jedi council . \\neach location is elaborate and complex . \\nlucas never settles for vague ideas about the look of his settings , he creates rich , spectacular landscapes , palaces , and skylines . \\nmost of the new special effects in his re-released special edition trilogy in 1997 were changes that allowed him to give the earlier movies the look and feel that just weren\\'t possible when the films were made . \\nmore than ever , in this new film , lucas\\' universe is filled with a menagerie of creatures , robots with personalities , and a supporting cast of aliens who interact with the main characters . \\nthe best such character is watto , a greedy tatooine junk dealer who owns anakin and his mother as slaves . \\nwatto has a scratchy italian voice and a short , paunchy body with oddly mismatched wings that flutter like a hummingbird as he floats around the room . \\nof all the computer-generated characters in the film , watto is the best done and most enjoyable . \\nspeaking of computer-generated characters , no review of the phantom menace is complete without mentioning the most controversial figure in the film : jar jar binks . \\nwith more than 80 minutes of screen time , jar jar is the realization of george lucas\\' dream to include a fully computer-generated character into the cast of the new trilogy . \\njar jar , a clumsy amphibian and member of the gungan race , literally stumbles his way into the path of the jedi knights early in the film and becomes qui jon\\'s accidental sidekick . \\njar jar usually performs a comic-relief role in the film , lightening scenes with his mishaps and inability to stay out of trouble . \\nthe animation of jar jar is nearly seamless , and he interacts with the characters throughout the film as if he were really on the set with the actors . \\nhowever , despite the technological magic that makes his character possible , jar jar isn\\'t completely convincing . \\nhe still moves and sounds too much like a cartoon to blend into a scene . \\nthroughout the movie , jar jar never transcends a \" roger rabbit \" -like presence . \\nyou accept that he\\'s there , but you never lose sight of the fact that he is an animated character . \\ninitially , i found jar jar annoying , but grew to enjoy the humor he added to the film . \\non my second viewing of the film , jar jar was a lot of fun and i didn\\'t mind him at all . \\na second reason this film continues the fine tradition of star wars movies is that the film is replete with humor and small details that flesh out the world lucas creates . \\ndespite all the film\\'s struggles between good and evil , and the sober musings about one\\'s destiny and \" the force , \" like all star wars films , the phantom menace never takes itself too seriously . \\nfortunately , lucas hasn\\'t lost sight of the fact that his films are entertainment , not high art . \\nfrom the bumbling jar jar , to a one-man , two-headed announcer team calling the action at the film\\'s thrilling pod-race sequence , to a cameo appearance by e . t . \\nin the film , the phantom menace is simply a lot of fun , with lots of half-hidden jokes and humor that can easily be missed . \\nand finally , the phantom menace works because , as in all his films , there is no shortage of speed and action . \\nfrom beginning to end , there are light-saber battles , hair-raising chases , and thrilling duels between good and evil . \\nthe pod-race sequence on tatooine is one of the most entertaining and exciting scenes in any star wars film , and the final showdown between obi-wan , qui-gon , and darth maul is arguably the best choreographed , most thrilling fight sequence lucas has filmed . \\nthe phantom menace won\\'t win any major oscars . \\nit probably won\\'t beat titanic\\'s box office record . \\nand it\\'s not even the best star wars film ( i\\'d put it third , after the original and the empire strikes back ) . \\nbut it\\'s an exciting and entertaining film , far better than your typical summer blockbuster . \\nthe film can\\'t live up to it\\'s hype - no film , not even the original star wars , could have done that . \\nbut it\\'s still worth seeing . . . \\nprobably more than once . \\n',\n",

       " b'recently i read 4 reviews of pleasantville-one from entertainment weekly , one from a newsgroup , and two from different online resources . \\neach review compared this film to the truman show . \\nwhy ? \\nthe only reason people compared pleasantville to truman is due to the fact that their lives are on television . \\nother than that , the two movies are completely different from each other . \\nreviewers seem to love to pick one movie ( i . e . \\nthe truman show ) , obsess over it , and make it a guideline for other movies . \\nwhen pleasantville and edtv opened , all critics seemed to treat the two films like they were subjects of king truman . \\nthe same goes for the thin red line , as well . \\nwhen it opened in decemeber , probably 98% of reviews compared it to stephen spielberg\\'s saving private ryan , giving thin line no chance whatsoever . \\ncritics loved private ryan so much , that they automatically decided no movie is good enough to reach its standards . \\nthis is why i think pleasantville was underrated . \\nif the truman show had never been made , pleasantville probably would have received better reviews , done better at the box office , and would be remembered after it\\'s long been on the video store shelves . \\nsure , it wasn\\'t perfect , and it wasn\\'t very believeable , but neither was the wizard of oz or star wars , and there stands two of the most prominent movies in history . \\nwith the exception of don knotts as the annoying \" tv repairman \" the film is cast perfectly : the ice storm\\'s tobey maguire is david in real life ; he watches the old 50\\'s sitcom \" pleasantville \" to escape from his feuding parents . \\nhis twin sister , jen ( reese witherspoon ) is a popular slut who ( steriotypically ) smokes and wears revealing clothes . \\nbut what makes her character believeable is the dialogue-those excessive 90\\'s terms such as \" like \" , \" whatever \" , and \" cool \" make her sound like the total dimwit she\\'s supposed to be . \\nthe twins , with a little help from a tv repairman ( casting don knotts in this role was obviously a cameo-esque cast rather than a true acting one ) , are sucked into pleasantville by a magical new remote . \\ntheir new parents , played by william h . macy and joan allen , are perfect in every way . \\ntheir new names are bud and mary sue , and right away they start to corrupt the town of pleasantville . \\nafter the siblings fit comfortably in their new roles , the movie begins to take form . \\nit\\'s just like watching a sitcom in itself ; you don\\'t want it to end . \\n \" mary sue \" has sex with her date , the school basketball champion ; when he tells all his friends about it , they stop preforming perfectly at basketball , and things start to take color . \\nsoon we learn that these people don\\'t know how to express true emotions , and when they learn to do so , they eventually turn into color . \\nthis eventually sparks a racial war between the \" coloreds \" and the \" black & whites . \" \\nentertainment weekly reviewer lisa schwarzbaum claims the movie has , \" none of the depth , poignance , and brilliance of the truman show . . . \" \\nyes , the truman show was maybe a little more intelligent . \\nbut the racial setting-intensified by the forcing of the coloreds to sit in the upper box of the courtroom-certainly classifies as deep , considering it\\'s what i least expected . \\ngary ross did not try to create an intelligent , award masterpiece-he just tries to convey moral messages within his work . \\ntake for example big and dave , his past films . \\nbig-be careful what you wish for . \\ndave-good or bad lying is still lying . \\ndid these movies win big awards ? \\nno , but they won the heart of millions . \\npleasantville could have done that too , if it wasn\\'t for snotty reviewers who set precedents with preceeding films . \\npleasantville : a- ad2am \" i almost lost my nose . . . and \\ni like it . \\ni like breathing through it . \" \\n-jack nicholson , chinatown \\n',\n",
       " b'cinematically speaking , gordon parks\\' original 1971 _shaft_ is not a great film . \\na bit slow at times and more than a little rough around the edges as it builds to its climactic explosion of violent action , this spirited but formulaic yarn that initially brought ernest tidyman\\'s \" black private dick that\\'s a sex machine to all the chicks \" to the big screen hardly qualifies as groundbreaking filmmaking . \\nyet nearly 30 years after its original release--and long after the genre it spawned , \" blaxploitation , \" died with that decade--the 1971 _shaft_ remains an extremely entertaining watch , never having completely escaped pop culture consciousness . \\nthe reason for this is the same one that explains the film\\'s connection with moviegoers far beyond the target african-american audience : the title character of john shaft . \\nwhile the fact that the strong , smart , virile , and superbly suave shaft is black is the primary factor for his historical and cultural significance , his broad-based appeal stems from an idea that transcends race : he is comfortable , confident , and proud about who he is , and anyone who had a problem with that could simply kiss his ass . \\nthis fact also explains why john singleton\\'s y2g revival of john shaft is as enjoyable as it is . \\nmuch like the film that started the franchise , this _shaft_\\'s plot doesn\\'t score points in the originality department , but the energy level and smooth attitude distinguishes it from standard crime thrillers . \\ncontrary to what has been reported over the past few months , this _shaft_ is not a remake of the original film , but more of a sequel/spinoff . \\nthe star audiences know and love from the original film and its first two sequels ( 1972\\'s _shaft\\'s_big_score ! _ and 1973\\'s _shaft_in_africa_ ) , richard roundtree , once again plays john shaft , who still runs a private investigation firm in new york city . \\nhowever , the focus of the film lies on his same-named nephew ( samuel l . jackson ) , who , as the film begins , is a cop whose take-no-crap demeanor constantly leaves him at odds with his superiors . \\nwhen a privileged young man named walter wade jr . ( christian bale ) accused of a brutal , racially-motivated murder is allowed to be released on bail , a disgusted shaft leaves the force and decides to take matters into his own hands as a p . i . \\nbut that\\'s easier said than done , for also standing in the way of shaft and his way of justice is peoples hernandez ( jeffrey wright ) , a dominican gangster who is hired by walter to rub out waitress diane palmieri ( toni collette ) , the only eyewitness to his crime . \\npeoples--or , rather , wright is also the big obstacle in jackson\\'s way toward commanding this film . \\npeoples is more of an outrageous comic character for most of the running time , and wright is insanely funny during these stages . \\nhowever , he isn\\'t so funny as to make the character come off as goofy and buffoonish , and peoples\\' eventual turn to more serious villainy is seamless and believable ( which probably would not have been the case had he been played by original casting choice john leguizamo , who bowed out before filming ) . \\nit\\'s no easy task to steal a film from the jackson ( who is his usual captivating , charismatic self here ) , but that\\'s exactly what wright does--and makes it seem effortless . \\nthen again , with such a talented ensemble surrounding him , it is not too surprising that jackson\\'s impressive star turn doesn\\'t quite tower over the rest ; he is strongly complemented not only by wright but all his other co-stars . \\nbale has already proven his ability to play an uppity killer in _american_psycho_ , so it only follows that his performance as a similar , less exaggerated character would be spot-on . \\ncollette lends the film some convincing and welcome dramatic weight as the frightened , conflicted diane . \\nbusta rhymes brings some good laughs as shaft\\'s sidekick rasaan . \\nregistering not as strongly--but through no fault of their own--are vanessa williams ( as tough narcotics cop carmen vasquez ) and a dismayingly underused roundtree ; they simply are given little to do in the script credited to richard price , singleton , and shane salerno . \\n ( jackson also has little to \" do \" in a sense ; some throwaway footage during the opening credits aside , his shaft doesn\\'t even have one sex scene . ) \\nthat singleton once again proves his ability with actors is an especially good thing since he\\'s not really an action director . \\nthis is not to say that he does a bad job with the numerous gunfights and the requisite foot and car chases . \\nthey move well ( as does the film as a whole ) and are reasonably exciting ; it\\'s just that there\\'s nothing terribly inventive about them . \\nthese set pieces are functional in the way the script is : they work well enough , but they\\'re unsurprising and conventional . \\nbut if there\\'s anything that a _shaft_ movie does well , it\\'s make the familiar look cool--and this _shaft_ keeps that tradition alive . \\nfrom the slick title sequence--scored , of course , to isaac hayes\\' ever-infectious oscar-winning theme song , which singleton wisely sprinkles throughout the film--on , the film looks great and easily sweeps the viewer into its world with its energetic bravado . \\neven a common visual trick such as employing fancy wipes for scene transitions not only feels unforced , it feels necessary . \\nstyle doesn\\'t exactly make for a great film , but when it comes to _shaft_ , that\\'s of little consequence . \\nwhat matters above all else is having a good time , and the latest _shaft_ should be just the first of many fun rides to be had with this bad mutha--shut your mouth . \\n',\n",
       " b'satirical films usually fall into one of two categories : 1 ) long-term satire where everything , including the jokes , is somehow related on a large scale ( i . e . \\n \" dr . \\nstrangelove \" ; 2 ) situation satire in which the comedy and themes are derived moment by moment and scene by scene ( i . e . \\n \" men in black \" ) . \\nwhat\\'s unique about \" wag the dog \" is that it doesn\\'t necessarily fit either of these descriptions , and yet is both at the same time . \\nthe result is a clever comedy based on an original , smart premise , even if the focus does tend to wander a bit . \\nif there\\'s anything that affects americans the most it\\'s politics and showbusiness . \\nin this age of information and technology , we\\'ve been so conditioned by the media and the entertainment industry in our ways of perceiving things , it\\'s gotten to the point that we are practically controlled by it . \\nwe need the media to bring us the most up-to-date news , but we also need the escapism of hollywood to counter all that thinking . \\nthis film starts off well by quickly establishing these ideas , and then presents an interesting scenario : if politics , the media coverage of politics , and the entertainment industry are so closely related , couldn\\'t someone with the power and authority to manipulate one of the aspects manipulate them all ? \\nthat\\'s the idea conrad brean ( de niro ) , a professional washington spin doctor , comes up with in order to restore the president\\'s good name who has been accused of child molestation just weeks before the election . \\nbrean , along with the president\\'s top advisor , winifred ames ( heche ) , fly to california to meet up with hot-shot movie producer stanley motss ( hoffman ) . \\nthey pitch him an idea to \" produce \" the image of a war with albania ( it\\'s a country no one\\'s heard of so they people will buy it ) . \\nsoon the wheels are in motion and the film\\'s riffing satire comes into play . \\nwe\\'re inundated with the hollywood mind set as motss brings in a number of experts to help manage the situation , such as a folk singer , visual and sound effects technicians , and a modern style expert known as the fad king ( leary ) . \\nthe initial atmosphere is rich with numerous pop culture references where everything somehow relates to something on tv , in the movies , or in the news . \\nthe characters\\' dialogue is witty and funny , although some of the actual jokes and gags seem rather sitcom-esque . \\nfor example , one scene shows motss and brean\\'s production crew filming an actress portraying a poor albanian refugee . \\nmotss ordered a kitten for the girl to carry , but instead wound up with a dozen different dogs . \\nsince it\\'s all computer-enhanced anyway , she ends up cradling a bag of tostitos with the kitten to be inserted later . \\nthis demonstrates the film\\'s ability to take a relatively ordinary situation and make it smart and funny just through the premise . \\nbut then there\\'s the gags and one-liners that , although are humorous , seem a little gratuitious in the long run such as motss not being able to remember the actress\\'s name , or , whenever a problem emerges , always responding with , \" this is nothing ! \" \\nby the time the film makes it to the midpoint , everything that is going to happen in terms of plot happens . \\nthe first act is quickly paced , while the second act contains most of the jokes and is the core of the film . \\nevery ten minutes or so a new problem crops up that motss and brean must deal with , and it\\'s always fascinating to see what they do and how they do it . \\nthe screenplay provides good characterization and actually deals with most of the problems head-on in realistic manners . \\nhowever , it does have a tendency to avoid things and shift its focus from the election campaign and false war smokescreen to something a bit off the subject . \\nas the third act rolls around the satirical nature becomes more concerned with the situations and less so with the big picture . \\nwhat had started off as a brilliant , somewhat harmless conspiracy to fool the general public begins to seem more like something that would happen in a movie . \\nstill , the situation comedy is quite funny , especially a montage showing the entire country flinging old shoes into trees to honor sgt . \\nwillie schumann - a war hero motss and brean concocted . \\ntruly great satire manages to create for an entertaining story that makes you laugh at the time , but think about afterwards and \" wag the dog \" at least succeeds in this respect . \\nhowever , in retrospect it seems like so much more could have been done , namely by extending the running time and filling in the plot holes . \\nthen again , it\\'s a valiant effort . \\n',\n",
       " b'studio expectations must not have been high for \" great expectations \" -- the film\\'s release date was pushed from late december to late january at what appeared to be the last minute , therefore putting any academy awards chances it has off until this time in 1999 . \\nit\\'s actually a smart move , because while this updated take on the charles dickens tale isn\\'t quite oscar fodder , it * is * strong enough to be distinguished from the cinematic dumping ground that usually makes up the first five or six weeks of any given year . \\n \" great expectations \" also demonstrates how to modernize a classic story right , especially after the excruciatingly wretched excesses of baz luhrmann\\'s \" william shakespeare\\'s romeo + juliet . \" \\n \" great expectations \" opens somewhere in 1970s florida ( the original story is set in 19th-century england ) , as eight-year-old finn ( jeremy james kissner ) meets a trio of people who will have a profound effect on his life in the future . \\nthere\\'s icy , 11-year-old estella ( raquel beaudene ) , a pseudo-playmate of finn\\'s ; ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft ) , estella\\'s auntie who\\'s quite off-kilter over a past romance that never took off ; and a mysterious prisoner ( robert de niro ) whom finn saves the life of . \\nfinn , who lives with his sister\\'s affable boyfriend ( lone star\\'s chris cooper ) , fancies himself an aspiring artist , and proves his prowess by whipping up an unusual portrait of estella using only ms . dinsmoor\\'s lipstick , eyebrow pencil and the wallpaper from her dilapidating mansion . \\nflash forward into the \\'90s ( after a brief stop in the \\'80s ) , and finn ( now played by ethan hawke ) , despondent over a strange hot-and-cold relationship with the elusive estella ( gwyneth paltrow ) , receives quite a bit of money from an unknown benefactor ; it\\'s enough cash to send him to new york to focus on a career in art . \\nthere , finn seems to gain everything he could ever want -- wealth , prestige and a high place in the glamorous art world . \\nwhen estella resurfaces -- albeit with an aloof fianc ? ( hank azaria ) -- finn also sees the chance to renew their mutual attraction . \\nbut she\\'s not the only ghost from finn\\'s past that\\'s going to be paying him a visit . \\ncomparisons with the afore-mentioned \" romeo + juliet \" seem inevitable since these films are the only ones in recent memory to plop classic drama into a current setting . \\n \" great expectations \" is a much better venture , though , because it treats its source with even-handed respect , where \" romeo \" was never quite sure whether to be a spoof , a homage or both . \\nthe movie is a visual banquet thanks to emmanuel lubezki\\'s sexy cinematography ; notably , he captures a revisited fountain kiss between the two leads with a luscious , erotic charge that\\'s steamier than the film\\'s ( surprisingly muted ) love scenes . \\nthe eclectic rock soundtrack compliments the on-screen action beautifully , especially new songs by tori amos , mono and duncan sheik . \\nacting credits are first-rate , often hiding the screenplay\\'s occasional slip-ups . \\nhawke is sincere and solid as a leading man ( something we also learned from \" gattaca \" ) , and his finn is quite a likeable guy . \\npaltrow\\'s estella , on the other hand , is rather underdeveloped . \\nwhile the actress is at her icily seductive best , we\\'re not told very much about her character , and as a result , it\\'s often hard to understand why finn would appreciate her beyond a physical level ( but , oh , * what * a physical level ) ; sometimes , we root for finn although we don\\'t quite understand why she\\'s fueling his fire . \\nrobert de niro is nice and sophisticated in the benevolent kind of role he rarely gets to play ; on the other end of the acting spectrum is bancroft , a macabre , throaty delight who mambos and sucks down cigarettes with an eerie enthusiasm that would make norma desmond jealous . \\nalfonso cuaron\\'s visually elegant direction helps to distract from the dry moments that pop up more frequently around the movie\\'s climax . \\nanother problem is predictability ; you can guess your way through the plot even if you aren\\'t familiar with the story . \\ndespite its script flaws , though , \" great expectations \" is undeniably romantic without being corny or gloppy . \\nand frankly , it\\'s nice to see a film that embraces softened sensuality other than explicit sexuality . \\nperhaps that renovated release date , awfully close to valentine\\'s day , will end up helping \" great expectations \" \\' seemingly average box office chances after all . \\n',\n",

       " b\"those of you who frequently read my reviews are not likely to be surprised by the fact that i have not read victor hugo's novel les miserables . \\ni don't know if a lot of people have , though i imagine many are familiar with the popular musical based on the novel . \\ni haven't even seen that . \\ngoing into this film , i had almost no knowledge of the story or its characters ( i even expected the film to be a musical ) . \\nwalking away from it , i'm kind of glad i had no prior experience with the material . \\nwriter/director bille august's film version is a straightforward , beautifully told film . \\nliam neeson stars as the miserable jean valjean ; in the beginning , he has just been released from a 19-year prison sentence . \\nhe is allowed to stay in a convent by a kindly priest despite his rude and destructive behavior . \\nthe priest's words of wisdom influence him , and he makes a vow to change himself . \\nnine years later , we are informed that he is now the mayor of a town called vigo ; nobody knows his real name , and that he is wanted for skipping his parole nine years ago . \\nconflicts arise when inspector javert ( geoffrey rush ) is assigned to vigo . \\nvaljean remembers javert as one of the prison guards who constantly beat him , and javert remembers jean to be a convict . \\njavert is hell-bent on upholding the law , and he does everything in his power to bring jean to justice . \\nalong the way , valjean meets and falls in love with a peasant woman , fantine ( uma thurman ) , and vows to take care of her daughter , cosette ( played later by claire danes ) . \\nles miserables is visually a solid and often striking picture . \\nthe production design by anna asp is authentic and vast , and the sets don't look like sets ( they look like real towns and villages ) ; gabriella pescucci's costumes are noticeably spectacular . \\nbasil poledouris' soundtrack is thick and usually well-placed ( though it does get a bit heavy at times ) . \\nmany scenes in the film have a memorable photographic quality , such as the climax , which takes place next to a dark river in the grey obscurity of early evening . \\naugusts keeps the story simple ( which i hear is a good thing , since the novel is so complex ) and easy to follow . \\nhe manages to develop the main characters and most of the subplots adequately . \\ni was also impressed that he didn't go overboard with flash and style , which is something so many directors seem to be doing to classic stories these days ( such as baz luhrmann's vicious tragedy william shakespeare's romeo + juliet ) . \\nthis film feels solid and whole , and each scene has a certain amount of importance and vigor that keeps the audience interested . \\nliam neeson is terrific in the main role ; neeson is the kind of actor who does solemn desperation extremely well , and valjean is certainly a man who clearly fits that adjective . \\nthurman , in her small role , is very good , and proves that she has a lot of range and can perform in a very non-glamorous role such as this one . \\nrush is absolutely incredible as javert ; i don't remember ever feeling so strongly about a villain as i do here ; he adds depth and complexity with subtle glances and nuances , and effortlessly makes each of his scenes intense . \\ni can't be as charitable for danes , however ; though i know she is a talented actress , here she tends to overact when it might have been better to underplay the character a bit . \\nles miserables is , as i've said , a solid , intelligent motion picture . \\nmy only complaint is that it feels a bit too easy , and perhaps too staged . \\neach scene is grand and huge , and exploding with poledouris' score , but i didn't always want them to be . \\nfor the most part , les miserables is not a subtle or deep picture . \\nit's a good movie , and tells its story well , but august tends to hand-feed us themes and scenes that would have worked better had they been more subtle . \\nhowever , in a film this exciting and well-produced , a few minor flaws are easily overlooked . \\n\",\n",

\\nkidnap affleck because he used to be a security guard at the casino , force him to tell you where all the doors in the place are , then dress up in santa suits , create some \" diversions \" and rob the place . \\non paper , it seems like the stuff of a potential caper comedy , but veteran director john frankenheimer wrongly picks up that piece of paper and thinks he\\'s looking at the makings for some sort of clever action-crime thriller . \\nit\\'s not like the man isn\\'t capable . . . \\nfar from it . \\nhe\\'s the man responsible for classic political thrillers like the manchurian candidate and seven days in may . \\nhe wowed me with some the most memorable car chases i\\'ve ever seen in last year\\'s ronin . \\nbut he\\'s certainly guilty of churning out some certifiable losers . . . \\nput reindeer games on the shelf of shame with his 1996 version of the island of dr . moreau . \\nstep one in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : cast ben affleck in the role of the world\\'s most generic hero . \\nhe gets no good one-liners , he doesn\\'t get to shoot or implode anything in new and interesting ways , and all we know about him is that he regrets his past as a car thief and wants a cup of hot chocolate and piece of pecan pie . \\nhis name is rudy ( short for rudolph , in all likelihood . \\nsee , it\\'s called reindeer games . \\nget it ? \\nget it ? \\nshut up . ) \\nin the past , affleck has been at his best as a supporting actor , and reindeer games does nothing to further his viability as a leading man . \\nstep two in making your movie as easily forgotten as possible : gary sinise\\'s villain dresses and looks like the most standard movie crook a filmmaker could have some up with . \\nhe\\'s dirty and potty-mouthed , he\\'s got long , scruffy hair and a goatee , and i fully expected him to walk out of the casino carrying sacks with giant dollar signs on them . \\nhe\\'s also extremely inept at what he does . \\nhe thinks garish cowboy costumes and santa suits make acceptable disguises , and he trusts affleck\\'s character to pull through even after , time and time and time again , he tricks him and lies to him and nearly kills him . \\nbut instead of tapping into the comic possibilities of this role , sinise seems to think he\\'s playing some sort of tough , smart , and smooth criminal mastermind , rather than the complete moron that was obviously written into the script . \\n[on a side note , gary sinise wins this week\\'s \" title ! \" \\naward , as he\\'s the one who gets to awkwardly cram the name of the movie into one of his lines early in the proceedings . \\nlast week\\'s winner was natasha henstridge for the whole nine yards . ] \\nhow to take your bad idea and make things worse : include two or three plot twists that , instead of making the apparently stupidity of the plan seem suddenly intelligent , make the plan seem even more ridiculous and unlikely . \\nthis is a bad movie . \\nand what\\'s worse is that , except for a few moments near the not-so-stunning conclusion as the preposterous is replaced by the ludicrously preposterous , reindeer games never really gives us the satisfaction of being laughably bad . \\nif they\\'d done that much , at least i would have been entertained . \\n',\n",
       " b\"taking a few tips from the pulp fiction school of filmmaking , go is the new feature from the director of the cult hit swingers . \\nthe story centres around a group of people , who include brit simon ( askew ) , and checkout girls claire ( holmes ) and ronna ( polley ) and the misadventures that they get into , split into three chapters . \\neverything from sex to drugs to violence is covered in a film with a much blacker edge in comedy than swingers . \\nalthough qt's touch is evident in nearly every frame , go is entertaining enough to forget about the similarities and just enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \\nliman , who also photographed the film , has a deft touch with the camera , and the film looks good . \\nthe film also seems to have benefited from a budget , with the night-club scenes in particular looking pretty good . \\nthere's a twisted sense of humour running throughout which ensures that even the darkest scenes get a smirk . \\nthe young cast are talented and help bring the story to life . \\nholmes , one of the dawson's creek cast ( a show i'm not particularly fond of ) displays much talent here , and despite her largely limited screen time manages to make a three dimensional character and never becomes a caricature . \\naskew is slightly successful , being rather obnoxious . \\nno doubt the filmmakers intended this to make the audience cheer when what happens to him , but instead of 'funny annoying' he's just annoying . \\nhe drags down slightly one of the funniest chapters , but the talent around him in that particular tale more than makes up for it . \\nthe real standout is sarah polley as the drug dealing checkout girl : her refreshing and deeply enjoyable performance makes the heavy going stories she is involved in much more entertaining . \\nalso entertaining timothy olyphant as the rather sinister drug dealer , who gives an nice evil performance . \\nthe script , written john august , is sharp and witty , with good dialogue and some funny jokes . \\nit starts off rather slow however , but in about twenty minutes the script has found it's footing and just keeps getting better . \\nthe stories are largely satisfying , although occasionally there's too much attention on one detail but not on another . \\nalso , some of the endings seem a little forced and lucky . \\nstill , the cast have a meaty script to get into and obviously enjoy it . \\nit could of tried a little harder in some parts however , and these parts lag . \\nbecause this is a gen-xer movie , the obligatory rave soundtrack must accompany , and go's one is pretty decent . \\nunlike other gen-xers movies , go never allows the music to substitute for plot or dialogue , which is a plus . \\ngo is a very easy movie to absorb into , and the audience really starts feeling for these characters . \\nthankfully , they never become two dimensional characters who are bent and twisted throughout the movie to fit into the stories mechanics ( like the heroine in 10 things i hate about you . ) \\nthey are who they are and they stay that way . \\ngo is great fun , and a worthy follow up from the director of swingers . \\nignore the fact that it steals from pulp fiction and very bad things , and just sit back and enjoy the rollercoaster ride . \\nerm , go to go , i guess . \\n\",\n",
       " b'a follow-up to disney\\'s live-action \" 101 dalmatians \" that\\'s better , more entertaining than the first ? \\njust as unlikely . \\nwith \" 102 dalmatians , \" the disney studios have proven that when it comes to going to the dogs , more is definitely * not * the merrier . \\n1996\\'s \" 101 dalmatians \" certainly wasn\\'t the greatest movie-going experience of all time , but it did feature glenn close in an outrageous , larger-than-life performance . \\nin addition , we had two amiable leads in the form of jeff daniels and joely richardson , and lots and lots of adorable spotted puppies . \\nthis time around there seem to be fewer puppies on the screen , and close\\'s facial and physical gyrations are starting to feel as old as the 53-year-old actress under that startling black and white wig of hers . \\nbut that\\'s only half the problem with kevin lima\\'s laborious film . \\nwhat makes \" 102 dalmatians \" such a collosal bore is its embarrassing attempts at humor ( here almost single-handedly foisted on a wisecracking macaw who thinks he\\'s a dog , voiced by eric idle ) , its rabid plotlessness ( cruella goes after puppies again ; winds up in goo again ) and most of all , the incredibly wooden actors who plays the romantic \" heroes \" of the piece , a welshman named ioan gruffudd and the blander-than-bland alice evans as a parole officer named chlo ? . \\ngruffudd is cute and harmless , perhaps , but evans can\\'t even aspire to that . \\nthe dogs upstage them both , of course , but in the case of evans , even close\\'s split ends are more animated . \\nbad acting , however , seems to be a requirement for this sequel , since g ? rard depardieu shows up as a french furrier with a haircut like robert de niro\\'s in \" men of honor . \" \\njean pierre le pelt is a flamboyant fashion designer with a penchant for fine furs and depardieu\\'s over-the-top antics mimic those of the campy close flail for flail , and wail for wail . \\nfrance\\'s most popular export besides brie has long since turned into a caricature of himself , and in \" 102 dalmatians \" the producers milk that realization for all it\\'s worth--le pelt likes to refer to the furry little critters as \" poopies , \" par example ( and ad nauseum ) . \\nthe finesses of the script ( attributed to four screenwriters no less , and far removed from anything dodie smith ever dreamed up ) are quickly dispensed with , since all it takes for a paroled cruella to be shaken from her years of successful aversion therapy in the slammer is the tolling of big ben ( ? ) . \\nthat done , it\\'s back to the mansion to roll around in her heretofore off-limits sables and minks and a plan to skin those little dahlings for the sake of a hooded designer gown . \\nthe dogs are pretty cute--try making a puppy look otherwise--but that\\'s pretty much all they are . \\nthere\\'s always the feeling that there\\'s a trainer off in the wings , coaxing the dogs to open doors , or pick up their food bowls in unison , or pop a tape into the videocasette recorder . \\nsavvy holiday goers should skip \" 102 dalmatians \" and pop the original 1961 animated classic into * their * vcrs instead . \\nit\\'s one dalmatian less , but 101% more satisfying . \\n',\n",

       " b'a movie like mortal kombat : annihilation works ( and must be reviewed on ) multiple levels . \\nfirst , there\\'s the rampant usage of randian subtext that pervades the entire movie . \\nbut occasionaly , almost as if making an ironic , self-depreciating remark , the movie tosses in clearly marxist imagery . \\nno no . . . \\njust kidding . \\nhad you going there for a moment , didn\\'t i ? \\nin all seriousness however , and to be fair to the movie , it * is * necessary to provide two viewpoints : that of a movie watcher unfamiliar ( or only marginally familiar ) with the whole mortal kombat phenomenon , and that of a fan of the first movie and/or a fan of the games . \\nthe first movie ( mortal kombat ( 1995 ) ) concerned itself with a martial arts tournament that would decide the fate of earth ( and it\\'s 5 billion inhabitants ) . \\nthe mortals won , and in theory this should have prevented the emperor shao khan from taking over the earth . \\nunfortunately , shao khan was a poor loser , and the very final scene in mortal kombat showed him arriving anyway , ready to take over the planet , as our heroes assumed a fighting stance . \\nthe first movie was extraordinarily entertaining for those ( like myself ) who are fans of the game . \\ni\\'d even go so far as to say that many folks who didn\\'t know about the game probably enjoyed the movie . \\nthe writers and directors knew the limitations of both their cast and of the basic story itself , and they didn\\'t try to overachieve . \\nthere were a lot of really cool fight scenes ( with really cool accompanying music ) , intersperesed with some distracting ( but ultimately non-intrusive ) bits of fluff passing itself off as a plot . \\nand , as we know , the movie was a smashing success at the box office . \\nmortal kombat : annihilation picks up precisely where that movie left off , with some introductory exposition to clue in those who may not have seen the first movie . \\nshao khan has decided that he\\'s going to take over the earth * anyways * , and to hell with some silly rule about mortals winning the tournament . \\nthereafter follows approximately 85 minutes of film that alternates between being confused , being trite , being silly , and being just plain stupid . \\none gets the general impression that the producers of the movie thought \" hey , that last movie was such a success that we can get more money and make a * real * movie now . \" \\ntoo bad they didn\\'t simply stick with the formula from the first movie . \\ni could write volumes about the things that are wrong with this picture , but here are the high points : \\n * the acting is truly bad . \\nsandra hess ( playing the sonya blade character ) is particularly execrable , especially in scenes where she tries to convince us that she loved johnny cage ( a character from the first movie who gets greased at the beginning of this movie ) . \\n * in one of the worst pieces of mis-casting i think i\\'ve * ever * seen , james remar plays raiden , the god of thunder . \\nin the first movie , christopher lambert played raiden and played his character as though he was in on the joke : a french actor playing a japanese thunder god being revered by chinese mystics . \\ni generally like it when actors are cast against type ( tim \" tiny \" lister , jr . being cast as the president of the u . s . in the fifth element , for example ) , and remar has always been one of my favorite \" utility \" actors but he\\'s so totally wrong for this part that he doesn\\'t even have the luxury of amused self-awareness . \\n * there are too many characters that are introduced as being potentially important , but then never seen again . \\n * there are a number of completely meaningless story sidetracks , including a muddled scene where liu kang ( robin shou ) seeks out nightwolf ( litefoot ) , has a mystical hallucination , and then wanders off with jade ( irina pantaeva ) . \\nfor these reasons ( and many others ) , i can only give the movie a 2 . . . \\n . . . unless you\\'re a huge fan of the games and/or the first movie . \\nin that case , the following critiques also apply : \\n * sandra hess , while being an even worse actress than bridgette wilson ( who played sonya blade in the first movie ) , is much more convincing as a fighter . \\nwilson looked like she was simply mimicing some movements taught to her by the fight choreographer . \\nhess looks like she actually knows some martial arts , and puts together a much more believable fight scene . \\n * in the fights , each of the characters does at least * one * thing they do in the game ( and often more ) . \\nsonya does her \" kiss of death , \" jax does his \" earthquake , \" liu kang does his \" animality , \" and so on . \\na big bonus for those of us who were looking for similar moves in the first movie and found them only rarely . \\n * there aren\\'t as many fight scenes in this movie as there were in the first , because the folks making the movie mistakenly try to hang a more robust plot in between . \\nsilly , silly folks . \\nand the lamest fight involved two of the women in what turns into a mud-wrestling match . \\nlame and so obviously sexist even i ( politically incorrect , for the most part ) noticed and remarked upon it . \\n * the special effects are generally better , except for the final fight scene between the emporer and liu kang in which both perform their \" animalities . \" \\nmotaro and sheeva are both more convincing and lifelike than goro was in the first movie . \\nfor folks like myself who loved the first movie and enjoy the games , i give this a 5 . \\nyou\\'ll probably like it , but not nearly as much as you liked the first one . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" jaws \" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams\\' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \" jaws \" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \" jaws \" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams\\' music . \\nhe\\'s building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark\\'s arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn\\'t let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn\\'t been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn\\'t want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \" it\\'s a perfect engine , an eating machine \" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \" jaws \" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it\\'s no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \" star wars \" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock\\'s \" psycho , \" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \" jaws \" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what\\'s right and going against the entire town . \\n \" it\\'s your first summer here , you know , \" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \" american graffiti \" ( 1973 ) and \" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie\\'s captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe\\'s slightly deranged , and shaw\\'s performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can\\'t leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind\\'s fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \" jaws , \" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg\\'s subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \" jaws \" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \" bruce \" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have

       " b'1990s would remembered as the era of binary movie events in hollywood - two movies dealing with the same subject , or , to be precise , same \" high concept \" . \\nin summer 1994 , that \" high concept \" was \" mad bomber action thriller \" . \\nin few weeks , \" thrillride of the summer \" actionfest speed was followed by rather action thriller blown away , so disappointing that most of the people these days associate the title with the 1992 thriller in which nicole eggert did few nude scenes . \\nthe movie begins in the prison in northern ireland , where gaerity ( tommy lee jones ) , ira terrorist with the great talent to make lethal explosive devices from almost any material , escapes from prison . \\nhe comes to boston , where he accidentally notices jimmy dove ( jeff bridges ) , dedicated bomb disposal expert within boston police . \\nfew people except gaerity know the dove\\'s violent past , when he used to be ira terrorist before becoming sick with violence , betraying gaerity and emigrating to america where he changed the name and started using his experience for good purpose . \\ngaerity holds dove personally responsible for his captivity and begins the campaign of bombing terror , directed specifically at dove\\'s colleagues , friends and relatives . \\ndove , who is just going to retire and start family , now must confront the mad bomber . \\nwhile speed doesn\\'t even try to bother with plot and characters , using them only as an excuse for long and spectacular action scenes , blown away tries to be more conventional and provide the action with some back story . \\nand that is the main reason why it is inferior to speed . \\nbadly written plot and badly written characters are sometimes worse than no plot and no characters at all . \\nscreenplay by john bateer and john rice , barely touches the complicated issues of northern ireland , using the tragedy only as the cheap backstory for even cheaper drama . \\nthe plot is , of course , full of implausibilities . \\nthe main one is the fact that movie fails to explain how the single individual , no matter how brilliant he is , can produce thousands of deadly devices and hold entire city at bay . \\nthose questions , same as in the case of speed , could be forgotten while the action goes on , but the pauses between action scenes are filled with cliched and predictable situation that should provide some background to the characters . \\nbecause of them , movie seems a little bit too long , and boring at times . \\nthe most annoying element of the film , however , is tommy lee jones in the role of mad bomber . \\nhis acting is so over-the-top that potentially fascinating villain turns into pathetic caricature of himself . \\nthis role is in painful contrast with the strong performance given by that same actor in fugitive . \\nthe film have few bright points , though . \\nsome of the action scenes are fine , which should be credited to director stephen hopkins ( predator ii , judgement night ) . \\nand forrest whitaker really shines in minor role of dove\\'s colleague . \\nbut , all in all , blown away is a film that was justifiably shadowed by its more famous , yet hardly unforgettable competitor . \\n',\n",

       " b'much ballyhoo has been made over this new version of \" lolita , \" made in a time when one would think that a faithful adaptation of the infamous novel could be made , over its use of pedophilia , and as such , it\\'s important to address it straight-forwardly , before any other ideals such as goodness and themes can be discussed , as this film has been in film limbo for a number of years , lying around in vaults san a distributor , and having critics waiting to either hail it a masterpiece or call it anticlimactic horseshit . \\nwhen seeing this film , after all the hoopla , keeping in mind that there are people , namely me , who are fans of the novel , who have been eagerly awaiting this flick since its creation . . . well , \\nyou just have to wonder why no one really picked it up for distribution . \\nwhat\\'s even worse is that seeing this \" lolita , \" especially the first time and if you\\'re familiar with anything \" lolita , \" is admittingly very anticlimactic . \\nthis is a real pity because when you really sit down to watch this film , ignoring all the crap that has preceeded it , it\\'s really quite a film , perhaps the best film by director adrian lyne ( although , really , look at its competition : \" flashdance , \" \" fatal attraction , \" and \" indecent proposal \" ) , at least besides \" jacob\\'s ladder . \" \\ni\\'ve seen this \" lolita \" twice : the first time , i wasn\\'t so blown away . \\nit seemed overly dramatic and surprisingly unaffecting . \\nthe second time , not really thinking about how i\\'ve waited for what seems like forever to see it and how i\\'m seeing it on a tv set on a premium cable channel and not a giant movie theatre , it really affected me emotionally . \\nthe story itself is a surprisingly heartbreaking one , which is why it\\'s such a good novel , and why this is such a good film . \\nthe story of a pedophile obsessed with a young 14-year old girl named dolores a . k . a . lolita is great because it\\'s not trash for the perverted but because it\\'s about human obsession with things that are out of one\\'s reach . \\nits protagonist , the comically-named humbert humbert , is not your average pedophile , but a seriously wounded human being who embodies how we are all destroyed by our sick obsessions and idosyncrasies . \\nthe character of lolita is almost a symbol of the forbidden apple in christian mythology , something that will destroy us but that we can\\'t live without . \\nthese ideas are all worked into this film nicely , but done in a way that is not heavy-handed at all , but instead lyrical and emotionally devastating . \\nthe focus of this film , and the reason for making it , it seems , was to really penetrate the emotional depths of the novel and bring them to life on the screen in beautifully dramatic images , and scenes which are blatantly over-stylized . \\nthe tone of the book is a comical one , but it\\'s also a tragic one , and humbert , telling the story from his perspective , blows every single thing out of perspective . \\nhumbert exists in a fantsy world of his obsessions and desires , and this reflects the way the entire film has been designed . \\nwe get a sense that perhaps it\\'s by doing this that humbert has really trapped himself into a fate that will ultimately leave him haggard and destroyed . \\nhe weeps uncontrollably and never lets himself get over his original 14-year-old love , and allows himself to embody her as lolita . \\nhe lets his feelings for her navigate all his decisions , and by the end , he has nothing but overly-dramatic feelings for her . \\nthe story recognizes the extreme of this , almost out of a test , seeing if the readers will really sympathize with someone who is socially deemed a pervert , and one almost wonders while reading the book if the author , vladimir nabokov , wrote the book as a means to bring into focus his own sick obsessions , and perhaps bring them to peace . \\nthe weirdest thing about this film is that by the end , when humbert has reached the finale of his obsessional journey , we can easily sympathize and even identify with him . \\nthe opening and final images of the film are the same , and who hasn\\'t done a similar action , that is wandering about without any sense of reality or anything else but a deep sadness in us ? \\nthis is the second time the novel has been adapted for the screen , the first time being filmed in - shock - 1962 , by stanley kubrick , who couldn\\'t possibly have brought the novel to the screen with as much faithfulness as lyne has been able to do , but did the next best thing : he economized for everything and came up with a droll black comedy about obsession in general . \\nin that film , he used the traps of society as benefits . \\nthe studio demanded the final scene , that of a heinous murder , come first in the film so to portray humbert first as a murderer and second as a pedophile . . . and \\nwhen you see it , it gives the film depth of a man trapped by obsession . \\nthe censors wouldn\\'t allow anymore than a couple glances and subtle dialogue to show the , um , relationship between humbert and lolita , so kubrick decided to play it as comedy , but still allow the tragedy to seep through . \\nlooking at these two versions , especially after reading the novel ( and we all know that when we\\'ve read a novel and see a film adaptation , we are bound to be angered by any size differences ) , it\\'s really impossible to compare them . \\nthey both go for different things , and one has a lot more room to be as sexually frank as the novel was . \\nand although it\\'s true that several scenes are similar , and are thus up for comparison , overall it\\'s unfair to say which one is better and which one is worse . \\ni have never been one for saying the level of greatness of a film adaptation of a novel is deemed by how faithful it is , and i won\\'t say that here . \\nhowever , this film is pretty amazing , mostly because hey , i loved the book , and this film nearly reminded me of it . \\nit doesn\\'t have nearly as much wit ( a couple comical scenes , and even a lot of good chuckles , but just not totally witty ) , but it does have the same emotional toll that the novel had . \\nsome of that is in the casting of the two leads . \\njeremy irons , with his deep , soft british voice and gentle look , is an amazing humbert . \\nhe\\'s droll in a very unique way , and , well , no one can look distraught the way he does . \\nhe brings a wonderful sympathy to the role that goes beyond pathos and really comes up as being easy to identify with the audience . \\nand when he looks at lolita with love , and she looks at him with lust , you know that he\\'s her prisoner for as long as he lives . \\nand dominique swain , who plays the title character , is rather incredible . \\nshe pulls off the tough role even better than sue lyon did in the original , wonderfully balancing the qualities of seduction , bratiness , and self-centeredness that marks the character . \\nit\\'s easy to see why she surrenders to humbert : she loves the attention , and knows that she can have her way with him at any time . \\nwhen he denies her something , she blackmails him effortlessly ( a scene involving a rocking chair and a little foot action is damn near classic ) , and when he stands up to her , she weeps and runs away , leaving humbert to follow her . \\nthere are two other minor characters in the film , one who\\'s a road block in the beginning , and the other who\\'s a reappearing threat to the relationship . \\nthe former is charlotte , lolita\\'s mother , played by melanie griffith . \\nin the book , charlotte is a monster of a woman : overbearing , constantly scolding her child , overly-religious , and ultimately selfish . \\nand she\\'s the one obstacle humbert has to overcome to obtain his goal , at least in the beginning . \\nas played by shelly winters in the original , she represented all these qualities ; as played by griffith here , she\\'s about half of them . \\nit\\'s annoying to watch a film and play a game where you try to see who could have done the role way better than the one on screen without mentioning the actor who played them first . \\nand even though griffith is not really bad , persay , she\\'s nothing more . \\nthe other is clare quilty , the writer who is also trying to seduce lolita , and succeeds , but at a price . \\nlangella takes a totally different direction than the one peter sellars took in the original . \\nquilty was a comic character in the original : a threat in the form of many forms , popping in states of rambling , german , proning , and eventually drunk . \\nlangella takes the other route , allowing all of the creepiness to be unearthed , and the result is a character who exists in shadows and low shots , and who meets a wonderfully ironic ending , the exact opposite of what we thought of him . \\nas you can see , most of these are not improvements or mistakes done on the part of lyne and his screenwriter , stephen schiff , but just parts of a whole new look at the novel , at least cinema-wise . \\nthis version is beautiful , and perpetually saddening . \\nthe camera movements are stylized , and each shot is breathtakingly rich . \\nthe acting is for the most part wonderful , and when we watch it , we really get a sense that for humbert , who is telling the story , the only two people on earth most of the time were humbert and lolita . \\nmore importantly , it takes us right up the brink of emotion , then jumps right over it . \\nby the end , with humbert sadly driving recklessly in his car , following what he says is the only part of his life he

       " b'bob the happy bastard\\'s quickie review : \\nthe mummy \\nbrendan fraser\\'s stuck in the past again , but at least this time he has something better to do than to quote sitcom lines and try to woo alicia silverstone . . . \\nfraser is the lead star of the mummy , the second directorial effort from action director stephen sommers ( who also brought us the decent thrill ride that was deep rising ) . \\nit\\'s a rough adaptation of the 1932 film , and i say rough because it focuses more on special effects than on some guy in bandages , like boris karloff was engulfed in . \\nbut who cares , the movie has a sort of swashbuckling quality to it you can\\'t get from , oh , say , godzilla or armageddon . \\nfraser plays a soldier who gets a premonition during a battle with soldiers in an egyptian ground . \\nbasically , it\\'s a little sign from the mummy buried underneath- a priest named ihmoetep who was buried alive for taking part of murdering the king and making out with his mistress . \\nhis plan- wake back up and wake her up also , making him invincible . \\nof course , fraser returns to the site years later with a librarian ( rachel weisz ) and her brother ( john hanna ) , along with a former buddy of his ( deep rising\\'s kevin j . o\\'connor ) and some \" americans \" . . . and \\nguess what ? \\nyup , ihmoetep ( arnold vosloo ) awakens and wreaks havoc . \\nfire flies from the sky , flesh-eating beetles crawl about , and , well , ihmoetep\\'s plan begins to unfold . \\nok , so it\\'s not really all that new a story , but the way sommers tells it is entertaining enough . \\nthe special effects from industrial light and magic are top notch , and the acting from fraser and weisz isn\\'t half bad either . \\nthe action is pretty intense ( favorite scene : the sandstorm ) and there are a few shocking scenes just to jolt you horror-loving folks as well . \\nno , it\\'s no phantom menace beater , but if you\\'re looking for a solid warm-up to the summer movie season , you won\\'t find a better film under wraps than the mummy . \\nif this doesn\\'t give fraser forgiveness from blast from the past and encino man , then nothing will . \\n',\n",
       " b'oh god how many john grisham lawyer films we have been munundated with ! \\nin a perfect world , \" a civil action \" would be a breath of fresh air . \\nit\\'s cynical about lawyers in a way that grisham isn\\'t . \\nit\\'s romantic in the exact opposite way a grisham book/film isn\\'t . \\nand , the capper , it has no distinct ending , and the law in hollywood films is that above all else , you must have an ending . \\neven if it\\'s based on a true story , a true story which hasn\\'t yet ended , you must supply an ending , a false one , but an ending nevertheless . \\nhell , \" a civil action \" is even more sly and more witty than any of the grisham works put together ( and that includes \" the firm , \" the only novel of his that will ever be regarded as a classic ) . \\nyet it\\'s also oddly and slightly unsatisfying . \\nweird . \\nthis is , in fact , a steve zallian film , not just the work of a hack , and zallian is the director of the much-admired \" search for bobby fischer \" ( didn\\'t see it ) and writer of none other than \" schindler\\'s list . \" \\nin short , i like this guy , and am a sucker for the way he tells his stories . \\nafter all , apart from the obvious it\\'s-a-holocaust-film and it\\'s-a-spielberg-film , isn\\'t \" schindler\\'s list \" just a damn brilliant film , not so much a holocaust film as it is a wonderful character study . \\n \" a civil action \" is the same way : it\\'s narrative is split between being a lawyer film and being a character study . \\nand it\\'s here that the film seems to go a bit wrong . \\nthe main complaint of this film is that while , yes , it\\'s an engrossing lawyerly tale , it has no real ending , and that\\'s not necessarily the problem with the film . \\nit\\'s that it\\'s just kind of unsatisfying . \\nif this were a great film , it would feel complete , and still end basically the same way . \\nbut this film just seems to end , and i don\\'t want to be stupid and suggest an alternate ending should be tacked on : imagine , if you will , being one of those the film is about , looking forward to this film , and then discovered the truth has been through a surrealistic and unpleasant hollywood filter , just so the many won\\'t bitch about what is , essentially , genuine . \\nbut the fact that it just ends is not , in all actuality , what is wrong with it . \\nit\\'s rather that zallian has chosen , in the last half hour , to adandon the traditional lawyer story , and chose the other part of his story , the one about the lawyer , one jan schlictman ( john travolta ) , who\\'s shown in the opening and throughout most of the movie as a heartless but brilliant lawyer , brilliant because he\\'s manipulative and he always wins . \\nit wishes to make it all about jan in the end , but the truth is , his change , although nicely done , is not full . \\nwe see him suffering from a personal crisis , and travolta does do a pretty good job in depicting his change of heart , but in the end , we don\\'t fully believe it . \\nand i think that the problem is when he has made his decision , the film choses an odd angle to go at , a noble one , but one that gives the film\\'s conclusion that of incompleteness . \\nin the opening of the film , we see him doing his old schtick , manipulating courts , winning cases effortlessly , and then discussing on a heard radio interview how great he is at his job and how much he cares for his cases . \\nin short , he\\'s full of bullshit and we know it . \\nin the film , he takes a case that is hardly desired : a town where several of the children have died mysteriously of lukemia and the source of the illness seems to be from a local factory that may or may not have been dumping waste into the river . \\npoint one , it\\'s not of the usual criteria ( jan points out , wickedly , that dead or wounded children aren\\'t nearly as sympathetic as those struck down in the midst of their success ) . \\npoint two , it has been through several lawyers . \\nafter turning them down , jan changes his mind ( a muddled scene - he stops his car on a bridge , looks out . . . is he feeling a sense of overachievement ? ) , and he and his team of lawyers ( tony shalhoub , zeljko ivanek , and accountant william h . macy ) head out to the town to do battle with the town\\'s company . \\nthey spend millions of dollars examining the land , test the water , what have you ( this is where stephen fry , a possible oscar nominee for his brilliant performance in \" wilde , \" pops up thanklessly ) , and in the meantime question the parents of the dead children , and then , unsuccessfully , the workers at the plant . \\nthey also find themselves clashing with a brilliant lawyer for the company , the eccentric jerome facher , played by robert duvall ( more on him later on ) . \\nas we progress , we get so involved in the way the story is being told , which is engulfing everything around it , including the individual and brief stories of some of the townspeople ( one of the best is a bit with james gandolfini as an employee of the plant living across the street from kathleen quinland , who lost her child , who begins to have a personal crisis ) . \\nthings begin to go downhill for the lawyers in the second half , as they are up against impossible odds : the judge ( john lithgow ) is not only a strickler , but a pal of facher ; the employees of the plant are either afraid or to loyal to testify ; no concrete evidence is being found , depsite the money spent to find it ; and they are quickly running out of money . \\nas macy mortgages everything he can , including their homes and their office , he slowly loses his sanity ( his meatiest role since , oh , \" fargo \" ) , and we the audience begin to feel a real loss of hope for our protagonist . \\nin fact , the last half hour is such a change from the rest of the film and so unresolved that it has been widely panned as not being up to par ( owen gleiberman , especially , criticized the film for not being overly-dramatic . . . i \\nsuppose like a grisham novel ) . \\nthis wouldn\\'t be so if the change in jan had not been handled the way it is : instead of having a change of heart and automatically being perceived as good , he\\'s seen as being still full of bullshit . \\nbecause he doesn\\'t take stock in the cares of his partners , and causes them all to lose their money and noteriaty in the lawyer field because he wants to help the people of the town , he is instead seen as being of good nature but not sure how to bring that out . \\nthe final half tries to redeem this , as must have been the point of making this in zallian\\'s mind , but what follows is a series of scenes where we merely see him making personal stands for his beliefs , and though he has changed considerably from the opening moments when he\\'s seen speeding back and forth from the town that wishes to employ him ( and thusly receiving two speeding tickets ) , we still feel that the big change in his life is that he\\'s not rich and esteemed anymore ( the film\\'s final title card is witty but in all actuality shallow ) . \\nthe fault is not that there is no closure to the court case ( it\\'s still going on , you know ) , but that its personal story feels like it needs either another chapter or another angle in the final one it has . \\nwe need to feel like the character has really made a big change in his life , and that the story is how a story of strife like the one of the town could inspire such a whopping change in his personal life . \\nit only feels like half of that . \\nmaybe even less . \\nand it\\'s not travolta , who does a great job here ( though never to be a truly memorable performance of his ) , but rather zallian , whose final chapter needs a rewrite . \\nup to then , though , it\\'s an engrossing drama , one of the best of the year in fact , and one of the best lawyer films , period . \\nthe reason is because it recognizes that a court trial is not about those being defended or prosecuted , but rather it\\'s about the lawyers , the knights who battle eachother . \\nwe learn that the company is almost positively to blame for the deaths in the town , but the reason it can\\'t be blamed is because it has the best prosecution you can find . \\nand duvall\\'s facher is such a brilliant character and he does such a magnificent job at portraying that man that it\\'s almost easy to overlook how subtley great he is . \\nfacher is seen as an elderly man , a goofy eccentric , carrying a broken brown bag with stickers on it , eating lunches out of paper bags , and making a point to take time out of his day to listen to the radio , and scold anyone who interupts him . \\nbut look deeper and you see a master at work : his evil and manipulative nature are hidden under the eccentricities that others don upon him , and it\\'s difficult as hell to clearly generalize him in any way . \\nthat\\'s why i liked this film : it\\'s hard to put a pointer on . \\nyou can never see exactly where this film will land , and even when the credits roll , you still aren\\'t sure what to make of it . \\ncall it the zallian effect . \\nsame thing happened with \" schindler\\'s list \" ( not that i\\'m comparing oskar schindler to jan schlictman ) . \\neach film is so greatly crafted that you can\\'t help but get involved in its broad storytelling , interesting characters , and , most peculiarly , the wit that comes along with it . \\nif only it felt totally complete ( like , say , \" schindler\\'s list , \" though at this point it may be unfair to make comparisons between the two ) , it might have been one of the best films of the year , and along with that , a full breath of fresh air . \\n',\n",

. \\nhurray for hollywood ) who actually calls the mohr character a \" nigga \" and says things like \" can you feel me ? \" \\nleave it to pay it forward to happily include a little minstrel act for our further enjoyment . \\n ( maybe spike\\'s flick wasn\\'t so misguided after all ) . \\nthese scenes feel as if they belong in a dopey comedy with feel good aspirations rather than the irritatingly saccharine drama that you\\'ll find yourself trapped in should you not heed my warnings . \\nwhile the filmmakers have stressed in interviews that they actually hope this is a film that could make the world a better place , to me the final product has the oily feel of a cynical politician contemptuously reciting cookie fortune slogans to a hopeful audience . \\nit\\'s a picture that looks to be tailor made for academy consideration , with the main players ( all previous oscar winners or nominees ) given big emotional scenes that are practically variations on their most lauded turns . \\none scene in which a slightly de-glamed helen hunt ( de-glamed here means that not only is she a fashion victim [her look is somewhere between goth queen and trailer park mama] , hunt\\'s hair is also natty and badly bleached ) verbally castigates spacey , feels right out of her as good as it gets oscar clip . \\nspacey , of course , responds in his cultured monotone , that could be straight from his low key american beauty performance . \\nmaybe the actor should get an award for coming off the least self consciously irritating ; though how can he not , even when he\\'s emoting spacey seems somehow shielded by a wry indifference . \\nthe usually talented helen hunt is the worst offender . \\nin one atrocious touched by an angel moment hunt slaps osmet , immediately covering her mouth with the guilty hand in that very same stroke , and with said hand still on said mouth , she actually begins convulsing ( dry heaving really ) , then ( and i\\'m not making this up ) she scurries to the kitchen tearing the place apart in a frenzied search for alcohol . \\nthe scene is so hokey it could very nearly be construed as a parody of hackneyed tv movie blow-ups ; it\\'s all very theatrical , especially hunt\\'s performance , which feels like a pathetic plea to the academy for another oscar . \\npay it forward has the dubious distinction of being a film that could be used as an argument for why actors shouldn\\'t get academy awards . \\nthe picture unknowingly affirms that oscars transform nuanced talent into overwrought expressionists . \\neven haley joel osemt , the wunderkind who was nominated for an academy award for his unforced performance in sixth sense , seems more divisive about his expressions and inflections . \\nhis acting has become broader , less intimate ; it\\'s as if we can make out the little munchkin\\'s thoughts : \" boy this outta floor em \" . \\nnaturally osmet is made to play one of those only-in-the-movies children , a martyr-figure who cleans up after his mother , lectures her on the ills of drinking , and even fixes her up on a date with his intellectual teacher . \\nnever mind that the two couldn\\'t be more dissimilar ; his mother is trailer trash dopey , and the teacher is one of those dennis miller-ey intellectuals who hides his insecurities behind a vast vocabulary . \\nnevertheless this little nudnik goes out of his way to bring the pair together in a scene that recalls parent trap-ish cornball antics . \\nbut oh how we love bright , articulate , self-sacrificing children who pick adults up by their bootstraps and guide them through life . \\nthey\\'re so adorable . \\nof course the blame can\\'t all be hoisted onto the actors ( though with the exception of the little kid , they probably should have known better ) , instead the brunt of it should be passed on to mimi leder , who directed one of the most thrilling episodes of er , then went on to make two awful genre films in a row . \\nthe first being the peacemaker , a witless post-cold war george clooney vehicle , and deep impact , one of the two films of 1998 to squander the premise of earth\\'s possible demise by a crazed meteorite . \\nthe first flick was sunk by an over reliance on clich ? s , and a complete absence of any kind of emotional involvement , not aided by an ending which actually centered around the diffusing of a ticking time bomb complete with digital read out ( apparently present for an invisible audience ) . \\ndeep impact has more in common with pay it forward ; it\\'s a movie that treats earth\\'s impending destruction in awfully simplistic terms , completely ignoring the havoc that would so obviously take place if the world believed its planet would be a goner within days . \\nthe film was full of inspirational speeches where people really said nothing , though the sappy score swelled up to make it appear as if they were being profoundly touching . \\nin pay it forward leder continues in this vein with her intermittent dollops of cynicism seeming almost like a rebuttal : \" see my movie isn\\'t as na ?

       " b\"there exists a litany of differences between a successful action movie and a successful suspense movie . \\naction movies are typically devoid of plot other than a simple byline which can string together several explosive sequences , while suspense movies hinge on plot and subtlety and the ability to bring everything full-circle . \\nfor fans of both genres , however , realism is key . \\naction fans want to know that the weapons and methods their heroes are using are authentic , and suspense fans want everything to fall into an explainable framework by the movie's end . \\non this advice , director john frankenheimer ( the island of dr . \\nmoreau ) strives for realism in an interestingly dynamic balance of suspense and action for his latest thriller , ronin . \\nthe depth of intrigue in ronin is quite amazing , considering the fare that's fallen into the same category over the last few years . \\nthe script , written by j . d . zeik in his big-screen debut , approaches levels of complexity that had people spinning away from mission : impossible two years ago . \\na certain number of people will be lost by this , but afficianados will appreciate it all the more and return multiple times . \\nfrankenheimer masters the script with poise , and tells us a dark but stoically realistic tale of a group of post-cold war mercenaries working to earn their paycheck . \\nhis ability to convey feeling and character while promoting explosiveness and tense atmosphere works well here , and ronin becomes a better movie because of it . \\nrobert de niro headlines this cast of noteworthies in a performance that is the most outstanding of his in quite some time . \\nhe takes command and offers much gravity as the ex-spy sam , a man who's called to france to help a shady operations controller named dierdre ( natascha mcelhone ) recover a package . \\nthe package becomes the central motivator for the entire cast , especially once the requisite double-crossing begins , and its role is skillfully penned by zeik . \\nat times , however , zeik's tale becomes almost too reminiscent of mission : impossible - de niro might easily become tom cruise , the package might become cruise's computer disk . \\nfortunately , the focus here is almost entirely on the package , whereas in mission the script was more concerned with the double-cross and why it happened . \\nthe action content is impressive , and it lives up to the hints given in previews . \\nthe only fans who will be disappointed are those who expect full-blown combat scenes and instead are forced to suffer through moments of slowness . \\nronin does take a degree of intelligence to follow all of the nuance from start to finish , but even the uninitiated will be able to keep a grasp on most characters mand subplots . \\nthe suspense tapers off considerably by the end , a bit of a drawback because of its height at the movie's open . \\nconsidering these factors it's good to see that ronin was a project that turned out well , and it's another good bet this month . \\nsince quality is usually sparse during the early fall months , it's definitely worth the visit . \\n\",\n",

       " b'after hearing reviews for woody allen\\'s upteenth movie in history , \" celebrity , \" range from terribly boring to just so-so , my heart lept when the opening images of the film closely resembled that of \" manhattan , \" my personal favorite from my personal favorite director of all time . \\nwoody allen\\'s films almost never rely on visual flair over textual flair , so when one of his films closely resembles the one time that these two entities fit hand-in-hand ( \" manhattan \" really is one of the best-looking films i\\'ve ever seen , beautiful black and white photography of the city\\'s best areas , etc . ) , a fan can\\'t help but feel visibly moved . \\nthe film opens up , with the usual credits with plain white font over black backgrounds , and an old ironic standard playing on the soundtrack , but then the screen fills with a gorgeous dull gray sky , with the word \" help \" being spelled with an airplane . \\nbeethoven\\'s 5th blasts on the soundtrack . \\nthe city seems to stop to take notice of this moment , and it\\'s all rather lovely to look at . \\nand then we cut to a film crew , shooting this as the film\\'s hilariously banal key moment in the film , where the lead actress in the film ( melanie griffith , looking as buxom and beautiful as ever ) has to realize something\\'s wrong with her life or whatever . \\nit\\'s a terribly stale scene for a woody allen film , with the great opening shots or without , and my heart sank and i soon got used to the fact that once again , a new film of his was not going to be as great as his past works ( though , for the record , last year\\'s \" deconstructing harry \" came awfully close ) . \\nwhat the hell has happened to him ? \\nthe man who once could be relied on for neurotic freshness in cinema has not become less funny , but his films have become less insightful and more like he tossed them together out of unfinished ideas . \\n \" bullets over broadway , \" though wonderful , relies on irony to pull a farce that just never totally takes off . \\n \" mighty aphrodite \" is more full of great moments and lines than a really great story . \\n \" everyone says i love you \" was more of a great idea than a great film . \\neven \" deconstructing harry \" is admittingly cheap in a way , even if it does top as one of his most truly hilarious films . \\nif anything , the reception of \" celebrity \" by everyone should tip allen off to the fact that this time , it\\'s not the audience and critics who are wrong about how wonderful his film is : it\\'s him . \\n \" celebrity \" is , yes , a good film , but it\\'s only marginally satisfying as a woody allen film . \\ninstead of creating the great woody allen world , he\\'s created a world out of a subject he knows only a bit about . \\nand he\\'s fashioned a film that is based almost entirely on his uninformed philosophy of celebrities , so that it plays like a series of skits with minor connections . \\nit\\'s like \" la dolce vita \" without the accuracy , the right amount of wit , and the correct personal crisis . \\nwoody , becoming more insecure in his old age , choses to drop the woody allen character in on the world of celebrities , and then hang him and all his flaws up for scrutiny , and does this by casting not himself but brit actor kenneth branagh in the lead . \\nmuch has been said about his performance - dead on but irritating , makes one yearn for the real thing , blah blah blah - but to anyone who actually knows the woody allen character knows that branagh\\'s performance , though featuring some of the same mannerisms ( stuttering , whining , lots o\\' hand gestures ) , is hardly a warts-and-all impersonation . \\nbranagh brings along with him little of the woody allen charm , which actually allows for his character\\'s flaws to be more apparent . \\nwoody\\'s a flawed guy , and we know it , but we love him anyway , because he\\'s really funny and really witty and really intelligent . \\nbranagh\\'s allen is a bit more flat-out bad , but with the same charm so that , yes , we like him , but we\\'re still not sure if he\\'s really a good person or not . \\nhis character , lee simon , is first seen on the set of the aforementioned movie , hits on extra actress winona ryder , then goes off to interview griffith , who takes him to her childhood home where he makes a pass at her , and she denies him . . . sorta . \\nwe then learn , through flashbacks , that lee has been sucked into trying to be a celebrity thanks to a mid-life crisis and an appearance at his high school reunion . \\nhe has since quit his job as a travel journalist and become a gossip journalist of sorts , covering movie sets and places where celebrities congregate , so that he can meet them , and maybe sell his script ( a bank robbery movie \" but with a deep personal crisis \" ) . \\nas such , he has divorced his wife of several years ( allen regular judy davis ) , and continues on a quest for sexual happiness , boucing from girlfriend to girlfriend and fling to fling over the course of the film . \\nafter griffith comes his escapades with a model ( charlize theron ) who is \" polymorphously perverse \" ( glad to see allen is using new jokes , ha ha ) , who takes him for a wild ride not different from that of the anita ekberg segment of \" la dolce vita . \" \\nfollowing are his safe relationship with smart working woman famke janssen , a relationship that almost assures him success , and his continued escapades with ryder , whom he fancies most of all . \\nhis story is juxtaposed with that of davis , who flips out , but stumbles onto happiness when she runs into a handsome , friendly tv exec ( joe mantegna ) who lands her a job that furthers her career to national status . \\nwhile lee is fumbling about , selfishly trying to ensure his own happiness , davis becomes happy ( \" i\\'ve become the kind of woman i\\'ve always hated . . . and \\ni\\'m loving it . \" ) \\nwithout doing a thing . \\nthe result is a film of highs and mediums . \\nthe mediums are what take up most of the film , with sitations and scenes which don\\'t exactly work but you can\\'t help

with bebe neuwirth ( droll as ever ) . \\nand , perhaps the best sequence : a romp with hot-as-hell teen idol , brandon darrow , played by none other than leo dicaprio , who is so un-dicaprio-esque that if any of this fans could sit through this film , they\\'d never look at him the same way . \\nhe ignites the screen with intensity , and spares nothing in showing his character as narcissistically tyrannical , and totally heartbreaking for lee , who comes to him to talk about his script that he has read , and finds himself on a wild all-day ride with him . \\nthey go to atlantic city to watch a fight , they gamble , and they wind up in his hotel room , where darrow gets it on with his flame ( gretchen mol ) and he lends him one of the leftover groupies . \\nallen\\'s writing in these scenes are so good that just for them , i\\'d almost recommend the film . \\nalmost . \\nbut what i really liked about this film is despite the fact that it\\'s a mess , despite the fact that what this film really needs is a good old fashioned rewrite by allen himself , it\\'s still a smart and insightful film . \\nthough some of the jokes are either stale or misplaced ( some seem too cartoonish , even for this environment ) , allen still manages to get across that this film is not exactly about celebrities , as it may seem to be ( if it were , it\\'d be extremely out-of-touch ) , but about those who want to be celebrities , and how they equate celebrity-hood with happiness . \\nwe never get close enough to the actual celebrities to see if they\\'re really happy ( they may appear to be on the surface . . . ) , but we do get close enough to lee and davis\\' character . \\nlee is obsessed with the phenomenon , while davis takes is at arm\\'s length , and never gets too involved in what it is , and soon becomes one herself . \\nbesides , it\\'s witty , and it does have the one thing that no other film has but allen\\'s : that great woody allen feel . \\nit may be not exactly fresh and lively or totally brilliant in its depiction of its subject , and yes , as a part of woody allen\\'s oeuvre , it\\'s merely a blip ( no \" annie hall \" but it\\'s no \" shadows and fog \" either ) , but it goes to prove that no one can make a film like him , and only he and maybe godard could possibly take a totally horrible metaphor , like the one in the beginning , and make it work not once but twice . \\n',\n",
       " b'the idea at the center of the devil\\'s advocate , which is , thus far , one of the three or four best films of 1997 , is that no matter what decision is made , evil will triumph -- god is a trickster , satan is a humanist -- \" the last humanist \" . \\nhe appears in many guises , and seduces many men and women -- in his own words , \" vanity -- by far my favorite sin \" . \\nal pacino plays this role with relish , and gets to chew some delectable lines ( \" lemme givya a piece o\\' inside wisdom on god . . . \" , \" i have a million names . . . \" ) , as john milton -- the devil . \\nthe main idea -- that he can appear as anyone , in any form ( in this case , a buisness man ) , harkens mainly back to terry gilliam\\'s the time bandits . \\nbut the film , is something else , something original . \\npart of what makes it so very good , is that it never takes itself too seriously -- it dabbles with morality , vanity , death , and child abuse , but doesn\\'t try to become any profound study of power . \\nthis is a marvelous confection -- cocky , funny , thought provoking . \\nit is also entertaining . \\nthere is no way you could possibly predict the ending -- it pulls back upon itself , drawing purely out of the mind\\'s eye . \\nthe final shot is more creative , more daring , more challenging , then anything in cinema since the white sock in the coen\\'s fargo . \\nthe central themes are fascinating ( sometimes reminiscent of james\\' the turn of the screw , and oates\\' accursed inhabitants of the house of bly ) , and the product that is built around it really wows . \\nits nice to know that things like this are still being made . \\n',\n",
       " b'because the press screening of \" planet of the apes \" was one day past last issue\\'s deadline , i was afforded the opportunity to see the film a second time , listen to audience reactions and read a heap of reviews before writing this piece . \\nthe chief complaints of those who disliked the futuristic adventure appear to be that the movie focused on visuals instead of substance , that the story was thin , that mark wahlberg\\'s character was colorless and that the surprise ending sucked . \\nto those people i would like to say ? what the hell did you expect ? \\nthis is a tim burton movie , boys and girls . \\ntim burton movies have great art direction and thin , clunky stories . \\nfor the blissfully nasty , disjointed and underrated \" mars attacks ! \" \\n ( jonathan rosenbaum of the chicago reader and i were two of the only critics in america to praise the movie ) burton reportedly tossed vintage \" mars attacks ! \" \\ntrading cards onto the floor and based his story on the ones that landed face up . \\nburton\\'s re-imagining of the 1968 story of an astronaut that lands on a planet where apes rule men looks great . \\nthe apes , courtesy of make-up magician rick baker , are dazzling and ape city is a wonder to behold . \\nlike astronaut leo davidson ( wahlberg ) , the film hits the ground running , whisking viewers through a head-spinning series of solid one-liners and engaging vignettes and establishing a sense of thrust that carries us through the more traditional fight scenes that come later . \\nas for wahlberg , consider what burton does with his character . \\nfrom his start as a filmmaker , burton has shown his fascination with colorful misfits ( pee-wee herman , the joker , ed wood , the ack-acking martians , etc . ) and lack of interest in standard issue heroes . \\nso leo davidson spends most of the movie getting the living shit kicked out of him before the biggest guilt trip in history is dropped on his shoulders . \\nas for lack of color , remember , leo only launches into space to get his monkey back . \\nhe doesn\\'t want to lead humanity and he isn\\'t looking for romance from a pretty , but dull human ( estella warren ) or a dynamic ape ( helena bonham carter , terrific as an equal-rights activist ) . \\nas a man who just wants out , wahlberg is focused , subtle and sly . \\nthe surprise ending provides the requisite shock ( and some more dandy visuals , particularly of the approaching authority figures ) , but admittedly isn\\'t nearly as satisfying as the one in the original . \\nfor the original ending to work , we only had to make one simple connection , for this one , we have to write a whole new screenplay . \\nthe 1968 \" apes \" boasted a handful of great scenes , cool looking monkeys , a deliciously hammy performance by charlton heston ( who appears uncredited here as an aged chimp on his deathbed , re-delivering a classic line ) and a killer ending . \\nbut viewers had to suffer through numerous dull stretches punctuated by social and political messages delivered with the grace of a wrecking ball . \\nthe 2001 \" planet of the apes \" offers a different set of great scenes , much cooler looking monkeys , fine acting from wahlberg , bonham carter , paul giamatti and tim roth , and a not so good ending . \\nit also gives us another chance to experience the skewed vision of tim burton and that\\'s nothing to complain about . \\n',\n",
       " b'since most movies about slavery shield us from the true horrors of what they\\'re portraying , it\\'s fitting to say that \" beloved \" come as a real shock as a film . \\nit\\'s confusing , bizarre , and as tough a film to watch as any film i\\'ve seen all year , and that\\'s not necessarily because of the three-hour running time . \\n \" beloved \" is challenging to watch , filled with tough and powerful poetry that takes us completely off guard , and instead of a straight-forward , hollywood-ized story about what happened to the slaves after they were freed , \" beloved \" comes off as a cry of anguish from all those who actually lived through what happened ( or , rather , toni morrison , who wrote the novel upon which this is based ) . \\n \" beloved \" tells the story of an ex-slave named sethe , played by oprah winfrey , who lives on a large farm in the north with her children . \\nwhen the film opens , her house is being terrorized by a poltergeist , which shakes things up , wounds the dog , and makes things generally uncomfortable for the family . \\nsethe is proud , though , and will not move . \\nher sons run away , leaving only her and her daughter , denver ( kimberly elise ) alone with the ghost which is there without any factual explanation . \\na couple years pass , and the ghost remains , and one day , a man named paul d ( danny glover ) , another ex-slave who knew sethe years ago when they worked on a plantation together , arrives , asking for lodging . \\nhe has been wandering around since he left the plantation , and when he enters the house , it turns red and becomes incredibly hot . \\nwhen he remarks about what he thinks is evil , sethe replies \" it ain\\'t evil . \\nit\\'s just sad . \" \\nsome more time passes , and paul d has become a fervent member of the household , and the ghost disappears . \\nbut when they return one day from going out , they discover a young woman sitting in the house . \\nher name is beloved , and as played by thandie newton , she has almost zero motor skills . \\nshe stumbles around , half-grabbing onto things and knocking them over , and when she speaks , she lets out a low guttural sound that eventually turns into baby talk . \\nthey let her into her house , and she begins to turn things upside down . \\n \" beloved \" acts like an incredibly difficult chamber drama paired with a ghost story . \\nmost of the scenes consist of people arguing in one claustrophobic , low-lit room , with the occasional flash to the past , where we see images of such horror that we thank god for modern-day psychoanalysts . \\nsethe and paul d have lived through such hellish times that they are forever implanted with the memories of their slavehood on the old plantation , which includes such images as sethe being raped by the white plantation hands , with her nipples being licked , prompting her to cry out to paul d when reminiscing about it , \" they took my milk ! \" \\nworst of all was the month after her freedom , when she was allowed to live like a free person , working with other blacks on a farm , and then seeing that her old plantation owners have arrived to presumedly take her and her children back . \\nshe runs to the barn near by , carrying her four children , and when her old owners burst in , they discover she has murdered one of them and is ready to murder the rest of them if they don\\'t leave them alone . \\nwhen she is inquired about this moment by paul d in a moment halfway through the film , she says she doesn\\'t regret it . \\nshe killed her daughter so that she would not have to live through the horror she did , and she has convinced herself she did the right thing . \\nof course , beloved is really her daugher materialized , though we aren\\'t flat out told that until later on in the film . \\nbeloved represents the pain and suffering the slaves went through and shows how difficult it was for them to deal with their freedom after being tortured for so long . \\nthus , \" beloved \" becomes a sorta-redux of the andrei tarkofsky sci-fi classic , \" solaris , \" where a cosmonaut discovers that his wife , who commited suicide years before , has materialized when he is orbiting over a planet with a complex brain system . \\nthat film spoke volumes about humanity and our memories , how we are constantly regretting what happened in the past , and when if it ever literally came back to haunt us , it would control us completely . \\n \" beloved \" moves along freely , without a lot of explanation , and for the most part , this is extremely respectable . \\nthe most interesting films are the ones that don\\'t explain everything for us , leaving gaps in the characters that we are supposed to fill in with how they act in the present tense . \\nsethe is never fully explained as a character , but we understand all her actions since she\\'s being played by oprah winfrey . \\nit\\'s been well over a decade since her last major performance in \" the color purple , \" but judging from these two films , i\\'ll bet she\\'s one of the best actresses working today . . . if \\nshe was strictly an actress . \\nher talk show , which i suppose is a great entity , has prevented her from becoming a noteworthy actress , and that\\'s a shame because she brings so much to this movie . \\nemotion . \\nsadness . \\nstrength . \\nwatching the strong sethe , who\\'s so afraid of the past that she\\'s built a rather strong protective coating around herself , break down when she discovers who beloved really is is what makes this movie really great . \\nshe makes it real . \\nthat\\'s not to say this is a perfect film . \\nin fact , i\\'d wager to say that the fact that it\\'s confusing and painful to watch is what prevents this from being the truly great film it is . \\nwhile oprah\\'s performance is powerful and easily sympathetic ( and i\\'m dying to see her win at least an oscar nomination this february ) , the structure of the film , which doesn\\'t show what happened to her children till halfway through the film , prevents us from really making a cohesive connection to the film . \\nit doesn\\'t necessarily move as though they\\'re memories of one particular character , and by the end , it has lost control over sethe , and as she takes to bed , we are unable to truly identify with her anymore . \\nbut despite its tediousness , perhaps that\\'s the point . \\nthe distancing by the end of the film may be just part of the way it has been built from the start , since they figure she has crossed over from being identifiable , and it needs to get back with reality . \\nand for the most part , this film seems like the cry of pain from the slaves that it really wants to be . \\njonathan demme\\'s direction is bizarre , in nature with the story , and he creates the right mood , making it a tough film to sit through , making sure that the audience feels as uncomfortable as the characters . \\nthere\\'s more to admire here , like the way that the flashbacks pop up freely and without real organization , just like they would be in real life ; and the way that the ending leaves it somewhat open to more pain and suffering , but laced with a touch of optimism . \\nthe acting , not only from winfrey , is amazing , and i anticipate not only she will get an oscar nomination . \\neveryone has been raving about thandie newton\\'s performance , and how it should be rewarded . \\nhowever , it must be noted that out of everyone , she had the easiest part . \\nact like a baby . \\nthrow things . \\nstumble around . \\nchew food with your mouth open . \\ni do think there\\'s another performance worthy of oscar conisderation , but it\\'s kimberly elise , as the daugher who has to stay sensible and sane , and has to carry the burden of her mother\\'s loss of reality towards the end . \\nit\\'s not that newton isn\\'t great : she\\'s as annoying and wacky as the role demands . \\nit\\'s just that elise has the tougher job and pulls it off even better . \\ndespite the fact that this film has winfrey written all over it , and not that of writer morrison or director demme , \" beloved \" has still not done well . \\ncosting , i think , around ninety million dollars , it has since grossed about twenty-two . \\nunfortunately , this film is a little too intense for viewers , even for me , and i can stand almost anything ( i recently viewed the 2 1/2 hour long epic \" caligula , \" the worst film i have ever seen in my life , and did it in a mere 2 sittings ) . \\nalthough i respect \" beloved , \" i can\\'t say that i really enjoyed it . \\n',\n",

       " b'starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . \\ntherefore , it\\'s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . \\ndespite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . \\na group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the \" savages \" that live there . \\nthe natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . \\nonly the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . \\nthe ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film\\'s finer moments . \\nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . \\ngovernor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . \\ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . \\npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . \\nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend . \\nagain , against tradition , talking animals aren\\'t used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . \\nthis is an odd compromise , but it\\'s one of the few elements that really work . \\nthe animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . \\nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . \\nthe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . \\nthe music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" \\nmel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . \\nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . \\ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . \\neven the children in the audience seemed restless . \\nwhile there\\'s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . \\nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . \\nit\\'s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie\\'s entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn\\'t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer\\'s minds and plot holes that are never filled . \\neven the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . \\nas mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . \\nfor instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . \\nif he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \\nor how about pocahontas\\' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \\ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \\nas it is , i wonder if it doesn\\'t give kids the wrong impression . \\nin short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . \\nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \\n',\n",

       " b'i have never been so confused after watching a movie . \\n \" meet joe black \" is probably one of the most visually satisfying films of this year , with a cinematography , music and cast that will dazzle most of us . \\nat the same time it is probably the most boring and ridiculous experience hat you will have this season . \\nat first you marvel at the elegant direction , graceful cinematography and sensual musical score . \\nthen you\\'ll wait for something to happen for half an hour , but when you finally understand what\\'s going on , you\\'ll wonder what are actors such as anthony hopkins , brad pitt and claire forlani are doing in a film like this ? \\nthe script is simply a silly and unresolved story , which is artificially stretched into a three hour long motion picture . \\nit feels like an eternity . \\nmost of the time it is a pompous soap opera , filled with empty dialogue that the actors deliver in a high pitched voice and \" meaningful \" winks . \\nthe film is based on alberto caesella\\'s play \" death takes a holiday \" . \\nthe story concentrates around bill ( anthony hopkins ) who lives a fulfilled life as a successful business man , but sometimes he wakes up in the middle of the night and hears a voice that is saying \" yes \" . \\nsoon he meets a young elegant gentlemen ( brad pitt ) who introduces himself as \" death \" . \\nit is bill\\'s time . \\nbut death has other plans . \\nit has come down to us simple mortals to find out what it means to be alive . \\nour bill is chosen to be death\\'s guide and in exchange he gets time . \\nbill introduces death as joe black , who immediately becomes the center of everyone\\'s attention . \\nbill\\'s business partners speculate about why joe is constantly at bill\\'s side , lives in his house and resides at his office . \\nthat is not all , however . \\nbill\\'s youngest daughter susan ( claire forlani ) falls in love with the mysterious stranger and joe falls in love with her . \\nthis relationship is bound to have some serious consequences . \\nit wouldn\\'t be fair to say that this film didn\\'t have some interesting moments , such as the scene where joe is invited to join bill\\'s family for dinner . \\nwhen joe starts enjoying peanut butter and later falls in love , the experience is somewhat different . \\nit is obvious that a story like this story is very difficult to structure . \\nit\\'s one thing to say : \" wouldn\\'t it be fun to have death take human form and come down to earth . . \" \\nto create a motion picture out of this is another . \\nfour screenwriters have worked on a script that lacks drive and logic . \\nit is overlong and too primitive to pass as a serious film . \\non the other hand it demonstrates incredible performances and a very decent direction by martin brest ( \" scent of a woman \" ) . \\nhopkins looks great in any role , and no matter how shallow or hollow it is , he will complete it . \\nhis talent and charisma are needed here more than any where else , since it actually saves the film from a complete embarrassment . \\nbut pitt is the one that got one of the most difficult roles of recent time . \\nhow can you play death in human form ? \\nto me it seems that death and life are not something that can be associated with earthly matters . \\nthey are not creatures , but phenomenas . \\nsaying that death takes human form would be the same as to suggest that eternity would take human form . \\nhandling such a ridiculous task is incredibly difficult and pitt deserves some credit for his work . \\nspeaking in a calm , soft voice , portraying death as a lonely , distant and powerful guy that is unfamiliar with practical earthly matters . \\nhe looks and acts more like an angel of death , rather than a demon or a red-eyed executioner . \\nclaire forlani and others are also fine , stretching their stereotypical characters to their limits . \\nunfortunately their performances are not enough to rescue this film from its self inflicted misery . \\nin other words this is not what i expected from the director of \" scent of a woman \" . \\nit could ( and should ) be better with such cast and crew . \\nin the end it seems as if they have all been intensively working on a ravishingly looking soap opera . \\n',\n",

       " b'it is with hesitance that i call \" apocalypse now \" a masterpiece . \\ncertainly , it had the pedigree to be one of the greatest films ever made , with a director known for producing masterpieces with ease , and some of the finest actors of the 1970\\'s . \\nthe plot , an adaptation of joseph conrad\\'s \" heart of darkness \" , was set in vietnam , and the timing of the film was supposed to be brilliant , coming on the heels of the end of the war . \\n \" apocalypse \" certainly has its moments , some of which are the finest in film history . \\nthe plot is fairly simple . \\ncaptain willard ( sheen ) , is a troubled soldier who came back to hanoi for a 2nd tour of duty . \\nhis mission is simple : take a boat up to cambodian territory , and destroy the command of renegade colonel kurtz ( brando ) \" with extreme prejudice \" . \\nalong the way , willard runs into a series of adventures , including one with lt . col . kilgore ( duvall ) , and a strange encounter with playboy bunnies . \\nwillard\\' s four person crew finally make it to kurtz\\' compound , where he discovers kurtz has set himself up as a god among the natives . \\nwillard\\'s experiences with kurtz take up the last half-hour , with a confrontation and eventual ending . \\nthe movie is visually breathtaking . \\nthe battle scenes are exquisitely done , and the score is brilliant , setting a murky mood of darkness that is first-rate . \\nthe collage of disturbing images that coppola presents is at times both astonishing and sickening . \\nthe vast amount of detail poured into every war scene is stunning , and there are many episodes that are deeply powerful which resonate through the entire movie . \\nthe journey to kurtz\\' camp is quite a ride , with psychosis setting in on almost every character . \\nthe most interesting one is kilgore , the lt . col . who cares more about the surf than about the mission . \\nit is at times revolting , psychotic , and incredible , and it is one hell of a movie . \\nthe scenes are bold , inventive , and powerful , and the acting is stunning , especially be sheen , duvall , and fishburne . \\nthe narration is exquisite , as is the mystery of kurtz . \\ncoppola sets about a hallucinatory ride through vietnam , kind of like \" saving private ryan \" on lsd . \\nthe film is jarring in its implications , and psychotic in its execution . \\nthe problems come when the film slows down . \\none of the major scenes in the film , where the boat arrives at the final army checkpoint before they start their search for kurtz , is a colossal mess . \\nthe dialogue is confusing , the lighting is atrocious , and the scene drags on for 10 terrible minutes of film . \\nthe true problems happen after the crew does come into the kurtz compound . \\nthe film slows down to a drag . \\nsheen seems forever captured by a madman , played by brando is a lazy performance that is not deserving of the accolades it received . \\nbrando is in the film for no more than 15 minutes , but is bathed in shadows the entire time , making the last half hour of the film visually pathetic . \\nthe scenes are poorly done , the dialogue is muffled , and the whole mess is utterly confusing beyond all belief . \\nsheen seems to adore this man , but why the viewers are never told . \\nthe entire journey is supposed to be a prelude for a stunning entrance of this god-like kurtz , but the scenes fall way short of expectations . \\ngranted , it has its moments , which are brutally horrific , but the general feeling is one of confusion . \\nbrando mumbles his lines in a incoherent stir , and my feeling was that this could never be a great man , this could never be a man who inspires hundreds to follow him , so why do they do it ? \\nthere are moments of brilliance , but the visual confusion dilutes the power of the scene . \\nthere are too many questions left unanswered with the character of kurtz to have a satisfying ending . \\nthe finest scene at the end is sheen\\'s escape , and his entrace into the temple . \\nhis rise out of the water , with the smoke coming off of his slicked head , is a brilliant 30 seconds of film . \\nyet , you cannot shake the feeling that there is so much more this film could have done . \\nthe psychotic ride is unforgettable at times , and indeed the film on the whole is very good . \\nit is a stunningly flawed expression of film , for it addresses major issues , such as man\\'s mental stamina during bouts of war . \\nbut one still cannot shake the feeling that this film could have so much more powerful , had the character of kurtz been more explored , and had sheen truly succumbed to the fate that the viewer thought he was destined for . \\nthere is too much good material in here not to be called a masterpiece , but it could have been so much more rewarding . \\n',\n",

\\nthe film confronts all these problems , paradoxically , by not cronfronting them . \\nit doesn\\'t simply plug in the \" right thing \" at the \" right time , \" it creates an entire reality where everything makes sense and said concerns are irrelevant . \\nbuilding a strong foundation is important to all forms of media , without which , what is there to build on ? \\nwe\\'re given some backstory here and learn a little about our characters , especially our main character , scarlett o\\'hara ( leigh ) , a beautiful southern belle with a will of steel , a cunning wit , and a tremendous sense of liberty in such an oppressive time . \\nshe knows how her society works , wherein everything she does can and will play a role in the shaping of her life and those around her . \\nright from the beginning we realize how determined she is to have her way no matter what the consequences may be . \\nbeing the most sought-after woman allows her to manipulate men ( and their women ) to ensure she gets her way , whether it be obvious ( i . e . \\nwho will be the one to get her food ) , or subtle ( i . e . \\ngetting married just to spite someone ) . \\nthe man she claims to love is ashley wilkes ( howard ) , a modest gentleman who does not seem to have the same passion for her as she does for him . \\nhe isn\\'t so arrogant and demanding as scarlett , in fact , he\\'s engaged to a woman with a personality much more like his . \\nher name is melanie ( de havilland ) , and she is one of the sweetest , kindest , and most likable characters one will ever see . \\nshe and scarlett become very dear friends , but she never suspects the jealously scarlett has for her , and the love she has for her husband . \\nher meekness is both her strongest and weakest characteristic - it defines who she is , but doesn\\'t give her much emotional self-defense . \\nacting a catalyst to the love triangle , and to the story as a whole is the daper , stong-willed , cunning , cocky southern business and military man captain rhett butler ( gable ) . \\nhe\\'s quite a character all right - everyone listens to what he has to say even though he\\'s got a bad reputation . \\nbutler makes no apologies for his vast amount of money nor his behavior . \\nhe tells everyone the much-needed truth in the rigid caste-like society where freewill doesn\\'t seem to exist , everything is done out of honor and tradition . \\nfor example , in his first appearance butler tells his fellow southerners there\\'s no way the south could defeat the north if war were to break out . \\nthis angers them , not for his lack of faith , but because he has the gall to say it aloud and boastfully at that . \\n \" do we have ammunition factories ? \\ndo we have food ? \\ndo we have a navy ? \\nall we have is tobacco . \" \\nall true statements and yet the south still insists he\\'s wrong . \\nbutler is a shifty character to be sure , but he takes such pride in his arrogance it\\'s appealing . \\nscarlett notices this too when she first sees him , and from the look butler gives her , we know he\\'s not going to stop until he has her . \\nbut scarlett can\\'t get past her need for ashley , and during a scene which sets the stage for the grand story , butler learns of this and continues to throw it back at scarlett forever . \\nand so the story goes on , with scarlett being thrown obstacle after obstacle in her life . \\nthe conflicts she must overcome range from taking care of her entire family to finding a proper husband , especially after she is \" marked \" for life when her first husband dies . \\nthis gives the film many opportunities to bring in more characters into the epic story . \\nsome are vital for only a few scenes , but their true signifcance will endure throughout the film . \\nin most films only a few characters exist for support in background , but this film is more realistic and believable as it incorporates a supporting cast the size of a small town and everyone has signficance . \\neven people in the background seem more than just extras wandering the set . \\nthe costuming design is outstanding so that the film makes for a real sense of time and place . \\nthe filmmakers could have easily set more scenes indoors and narrowly focused to avoid having to show the outside , real world , but these types of simple approaches are never taken . \\nthe first half of the film depicts the traumatic experience the south faced at the last days of the civil war . \\nfleming is able to convey the horror of it all by painting an image of destruction and letting the viewer decide just how bad it is . \\none scene has scarlett working as a nurse at a military hospital while we hear a soldier in the background screaming , \" no ! \\nnot my leg ! \\ndon\\'t cut off my leg ! \" \\nanother scene shows her simplying trying to cross a street , but as the camera pulls back , we see that her path is blocked by hundreds of wounded soldiers , but it is their moaning that\\'s more graphic than all the bloody gore could ever be . \\nas the second half begins , the film concentrates more on scarlett as a completely independent woman who single-handedly takes care of her family and melanie just to spite the tyrany of the north . \\nshe manages to resurrect the family plantation , but all the willpower she has can\\'t help her when she must pay exuberhant taxes set by the north after the south\\'s ultimate defeat . \\nthis brings rhett butler back into the picture and thus begins their torrid love- hate relationship . \\nmost of the second half of the film is somehow related to the relationship ( or lack thereof ) between rhett and scarlett . \\neach uses the other for personal gain , but at the same time they still feel an intimate connection with each other . \\nscarlett continues to use her manipulative powers over men to get what she wants and because rhett can\\'t help but want her more every time she tries to one-up him such as marrying another man and taking over his business . \\nthey say opposites attract , but the conflict between rhett and scarlett goes way beyond opposing personalities , it borders on magnetic polarization . \\nthey need each other and know this , yet they never seem truly happy together . \\nperhaps they mistake love for passion , and the film leaves it up to us to make this call . \\nboth have things the other wants and vice versa , but when they compromise , is it just to get their own way or because they actually care for each other . \\nlove and the perception of love are two completely separate things and throughout the final act of the film , we\\'re left wondering if rhett and scarlett ever truly loved each other and why . \\ngable and leigh do have great chemistry , always leaving the viewer wondering which emotions were authentic and which were manufacture . \\nall ? \\nnone ? \\neither way is possible and it\\'s a mystery that cannot be solved even upon repeated viewings . \\nit\\'s safe to say most of us won\\'t live such overly dramatic lives as those in \" gone with the wind , \" but it\\'s still a masterpiece for its ability to give us a sense that we\\'ve just experienced a life\\'s worth of joy and pain . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" meg ryan is irresistible in the comedy that celebrates sisterhood ! , \" \\nscreams the television ads for \" hanging up , \" disastrously written by real-life sisters delia and nora ephron and sloppily directed by diane keaton . \\nmake me laugh again ! \\nnot only is \" hanging up \" misadvertised , since the film wholeheartedly focuses on middle sister meg ryan and gives her two co-stars , lisa kudrow and diane keaton , little more than extended cameos , but they don\\'t actually come together until the final ten to fifteen minutes . \\nand we are supposed to believe their strong bond , and smile in the last scene when they rekindle their rocky relationship , despite them being apart for the majority of the running time ? \\nexcuse me , again , while i almost bust a gut at that truly delusional notion . \\neve marks ( meg ryan ) is the middle mozzell sister , still living in the california town where she grew up , and with a husband ( adam arkin ) and pre-teen son ( jesse james ) . \\nher elderly , wisecracking father , lou ( walter matthau , in his brightest performance in years ) has just recently been put into the hospital , in the final stages of what i assume is alzheimer\\'s ( even though the film never enlightens us on exactly what is wrong with him ) . \\nwhile eve\\'s relationship with her mother ( cloris leachman ) is nearly nonexistent , since she ran out on lou and her children years ago , she has had her fair share of up\\'s and down\\'s with lou , who used to be an alcoholic . \\nher older sister is georgia ( diane keaton ) , an editor for the self-titled magazine , \" georgia , \" while maddy ( lisa kudrow ) is the youngest , a soap opera actress . \\ninterestingly , their professions are given , but we not once ever see them working at their jobs , or , for that matter , learn much of anything about them . \\nmaddy , georgia , and eve do not see each other much anymore , their adult lives gradually causing them to drift apart , but they do manage to consistently talk on the phone to one another . \\nand they talk . \\nand talk . \\nand talk . . . \\nin fact , the telephone is the major star of the film , even more so than ryan , as it appears in virtually every scene of this interminable 92-minute catastrophe that feels like its three hours long . \\nif you are able to get through the opening half-hour , in which phones ring so much you feel like jumping through the screen and taking a sledgehammer to them , you will surely survive the rest . \\nthe question is , who would want to subject themselves to this resolutely irritating , self-involved pat-on-the-back ? \\nhow could a comedy-drama that has the star-power of meg ryan , lisa kudrow , and diane keaton be so very bad in so many different ways ? \\nissues from the past involving the possible jealousy each has had for one of the others is fleetingly brought up , but the film isn\\'t mature enough to deal with such a thing in a thoughtful manner , and since we learn next to nothing about their childhood , it is a lost cause that comes off as nothing more than an afterthought . \\nalso , it is expected that the viewer quickly catch on to the tricky dynamic that the three sisters have with one another , but no dynamic metamorphosizes . \\nand when they do reunite in the finale , their whole consanguinity is reduced to a repulsively annoying three-minute scene in which they argue like little children . \\nyou can see the impending death coming a mile away , and it conveniently occurs in the next scene , so that the three can quickly come to terms with themselves , and with each other . \\nyou think to yourself : \" the only thing left for them to do is have a playful food-fight , \" and like clockwork , it also occurs by the end credits . \\nmeg ryan is a versatile actress ( look no further than 1998\\'s \" hurlyburly \" or 1994\\'s \" when a man loves a woman \" ) , despite her various detractors who stubbornly believe all she can do is romantic comedies . \\nwith \" hanging up , \" the only thing she needs to do is completely sever her filmmaking ties with nora ephron , a writer/director/hack who shouldn\\'t be allowed to work in hollywood again after this big-budget , high-profile debacle . \\neven if she knew what she was making was not exactly up to par in the quality department , she nonetheless is very good , and the two scenes that work , flashbacks to christmas 1988 , when she had a heartbreaking run-in with her mother , and to halloween 1993 , when lou crashed her son\\'s birthday party in a drunken stupor , are effective because of the realism ryan brings to the situations . \\ndiane keaton , as georgia , is better as an actress than a director here , but that is a wildly feeble compliment . \\nwhat is more than a little far-fetched is that keaton is distinctly older than ryan and kudrow , although in the very brief glimpses we get at them as children , she is no more than five years ryan\\'s senior . \\nyeah , right . \\nlastly , poor lisa kudrow has been wasted once again in a big-screen venture , after her even more thin role in 1999\\'s \" analyze this . \" \\nkudrow isn\\'t given enough time to create a full personality with maddy , so it isn\\'t her fault she doesn\\'t register until a few quiet moments sprinkled throughout where she is actually blessed with being given dialogue . \\nif anything , though , kudrow is a real talent , and i anxiously await the next time she is given a role more deserving of her time , as in her brilliantly nuanced , oscar-caliber work in 1998\\'s \" the opposite of sex . \" \\nif you are a fan of kudrow\\'s ( and who isn\\'t ? ) , do yourself a favor and rent this gem that puts more good use to kudrow in sixty seconds than \" hanging up \" does in its entirety . \\nas eve\\'s hardworking husband , adam arkin is , predictably , squandered with a role that gives him next to nothing to do , until a subplot reveals itself midway through , only to never be mentioned again . \\ncloris leachman , as with ryan and matthau , makes a small , but noticeable impression with her , albeit , very brief appearance , while edie mcclurg , as a rosy-cheeked woman lou had an affair with in the christmas 1988 flashback , manages one of the few laughs in this otherwise joyless production . \\nnearly all the emotions displayed within \" hanging up \" are patently manufactured , and despite the movie wanting the viewer to care about the characters , aside from eve , why would you want to when they are all spoiled brats ? \\nif , for some bizarre , \" twilight zone \" -type of reason , you find yourself in a movie theater showing this film , my suggestion would be to hang up on it before the opening credits are over . \\nsaying it is a waste of time is an understatement of epic proportions . \\n',\n",

       " b'warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . \\nbut it doesn\\'t really make much of a difference . \\ndeep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . \\nremember when dante\\'s peak came out in february ? \\na few months later , volcano was released . \\nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \\nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \\nwell , it\\'s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \\nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \\nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante\\'s peak . \\nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \\napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \\nto be completely honest , i haven\\'t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \\nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \\ndeep impact doesn\\'t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \\nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \\ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \\na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \\namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \\nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \\nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \\na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \\nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \\nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \\nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \\nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \\nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \\nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \\nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \\nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \\nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \\nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \\nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \\nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \\na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \\nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won\\'t kill off the entire human race . \\nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \\nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \\njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \\nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \\nit\\'s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \\nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \\nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \\nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won\\'t work . \\ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \\nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \\nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \\nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \\nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \\nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \\nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it\\'s that boring . \\nof course , leder isn\\'t all to blame for it . \\nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \\nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \\nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \\nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \\nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \\nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can\\'t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \\nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \\nthat\\'s right , 80% miss , and 20% hit . \\nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \\nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \\nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that\\'s forgiveable . \\nwhat isn\\'t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \\ngive me a break , will ya ? \\nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \\nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \\nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \\ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \\nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \\njust when we think visual effects can\\'t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \\none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder\\'s direction , which also influences the actors . \\nleder loves to show the actors\\' faces before and during moments of terror . \\nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \\nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \\nleder likes to flaunt people\\'s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \\none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \\nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person\\'s face while drifting into space . \\nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \\non another note , leder\\'s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \\nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \\nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it\\'s obvious it will be emotional . \\nit\\'s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn\\'t work for me . \\nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \\nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv\\'s \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \\nher character is made stronger by leoni\\'s presence , and we grow to care for her . \\nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \\nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn\\'t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \\nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \\nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \\nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \\nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \\nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \\na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \\neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \\ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv\\'s \" star trek : the next generation . \" \\nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \\noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \\ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \\nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \\nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \\nit\\'s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn\\'t worth much . \\ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \\nwell , it\\'s not . \\nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \\n',\n",

larry ( spacey ) and phil ( devito ) , who are veteran salesmen , having teamed together for the last twelve years , while bob ( facinelli ) is a young man who has just recently been hired by the firm and works in the research department . \\nthese three are virtually imprisoned in their small hospitality suite waiting to meet the big kahuna , as the focus of this claustrophobic film is on their

above the fray and he pitches every chance he can get about his belief in jesus christ . \\nhis vacuous character and smug outlook on life are covered by a disarming smile and an eagerness for him to prove in his actions the words of jesus he literally believes in . \\nbob is a baptist , who takes a very non-questioning and literal attitude about religion . \\nto just look at another woman and

his attack mode to establish how serious he is about being a salesman . \\nhe criticizes phil for being so placid , for getting such a small suite , for having the cheap food tray of carrot sticks rather than the one of stuffed shrimp , and for being burned-out . \\nhe tells him to go on a vacation . \\nget a woman . \\nwhile phil is reflective on where all his best years have gone for him and

       " b'contact ( pg ) there\\'s a moment late in robert zemeckis\\'s contact where i was reminded of why i started writing movie reviews in the first place . \\nwe see a scientist , dressed in a silvery space suit , walking tentatively across a narrow walkway leading inside a compact , spherical space pod , unaware of what awaits when the ball literally drops . \\nanticipation , excitement , anxiety , fear--the audience experiences it all the emotional tension right with the character , nervously , breathlessly eager to see what lies ahead . \\nit is this sense of discovery , the anticipation of which and its accompanying exhilaration , that makes this adaptation of the carl sagan novel such magical , captivating entertainment . \\njodie foster stars as dr . ellie arroway , a brilliant astronomer who dedicates her entire life to searching outer space for extraterrestrial radio signals . \\nand i mean life--after losing her entire family when she was young , the only thing occupying ellie\\'s world is this quest to discover life beyond this earth . \\nafter dealing with much skepticism on the part of government officials and wealthy financiers , ellie receives her vindication when she stumbles upon an incoming radio transmission from the distant star vega , which includes instructions on building an interstellar transport . \\nfrom this synopsis , contact does not sound too different to most films about alien contact , but there is a whole lot more to this intelligent film than the sci-fi hook . \\nthe alien contact angle generates a great amount of suspense and awe , but perhaps more than anything else , contact is a character study of ellie , whose obsession with empirical , scientific evidence has erased all belief in a higher power . \\nthe irony is that , while admitting to having no religious faith , she holds onto her belief in extraterrestrial life with such passion and conviction that it becomes , in a sense , a religion in its own right . \\nit would be easy for scripters james v . hart and michael goldenberg , in trying to paint a positive image of the heroine , to champion her scientific beliefs over religious ones , but they wisely eschew easy answers , giving equal time to both sides , and in so doing depict ellie as not completely sane . \\nin the end , there is no right or wrong , nor is there one side that comes off more positive in the other , even slightly so--there are just two very viable points of view , each with their own merits , each with their own faults . \\nthe complex role of ellie is an actress\\'s dream , and foster , a virtual shoo-in for yet another best actress oscar nomination next year , more than rises to the challenge . \\nshe conveys intelligence , determination , warmth , and , in a gutsy move , always on edge . \\nwe root for ellie and feel for her , but we also feel at times that she goes too far . \\ncontact is clearly foster\\'s vehicle , but others are given their chance to shine in smaller roles . \\nmatthew mcconaughey , who receives outrageously high billing for his smallish role , holds his own as the religious counterpoint to ellie , spiritual scholar and government adviser palmer joss ( however , his main storyline , the tentative palmer-ellie romance , is the film\\'s weakest subplot ) . \\njohn hurt is effectively creepy as s . r . \\nhadden , the wealthy eccentric who provides ellie with her research funding . \\nangela bassett continues to impress in her bit role as white house aide rachel constantine . \\nmost memorable of all , though , are tom skerritt and james woods , who play rival scientist dr . david drumlin and national security adviser michael litz , respectively ; both , especially skerritt , embody these asshole characters that the audience hissed just about every single one of their appearances . \\nzemeckis comes off of his three-year break in top shape . \\nalways known as a director of effects-laden extravaganzas , it comes as no surprise that contact\\'s visual effects are quite stunning . \\nthe central space journey is more than a little reminiscent of the close of 2001 : a space odyssey , but with more advanced technology at his disposal , zemeckis\\'s voyage is even trippier than stanley kubrick\\'s yet more wondrously pure . \\nand zemeckis doesn\\'t resist the urge to use the always-interesting incorporate-actors-into-existing-film-footage effect , which is every bit as seamless here as it was in forrest gump . \\neffects , however , are confined to only a few scenes and clearly take a back seat to the drama , emotion , and pure wonder , which zemeckis proved to be quite adept at in gump . \\nit says a lot that , in a summer science fiction film such as this , it\\'s not so much the effects that stay with you as it is the drama and the issues that are raised . \\nthe thought-provoking , two-hour-plus contact is a much-welcome change of pace from summer no-brainers , but the fact that it is a smart film does not mean that it also isn\\'t entertaining . \\nfor all the interesting questions it asks , the film is still what it\\'s being sold as-- \" a journey to the heart of the universe . \" \\nand what a fascinating , unforgettable journey it is . \\n',\n",
       " b'if the current trends of hollywood filmmaking continue , we are probably five or six years away from the moment when the 1980s would become the next golden age of movie nostalgia . \\nalthough some hollywood products already use the last decade as a background for their stories ( mostly in ironic way , like grosse pointe blank and romy & michelle\\'s high school reunion ) , some time should pass before the good memories of that era overcome the bad ones . \\nuntil that happens , 1980s would be remembered as the decade of greed , when the revolutionary ideals of 1960s turned into its cruel , materialistic opposite and the money became the only thing that matters . \\ncontemporary movies are good in illustrating what was bad for the people who had to live in those times . \\none of such movies , one that probably brings the essence of 1980s to the screen , is william friedkin\\'s to live and die in l . a . \\nthe money isn\\'t just the symbolic motive in the film , it is the major elements of the plot . \\nrick masters ( willem dafoe ) is an ex-convict who used his artistic abilities in order to become one of the best counterfeiters in l . a . being too intelligent to fall into police traps , and ruthless enough to eliminate anybody or anything that could jeopardise his career , masters managed to elude law for years and became well- connected . \\nrichard chance ( william l . petersen ) is a secret service agent , adrenaline junkie whose life gets new meaning after his partner got killed by masters . \\nhowever , his plans of bringing the counterfeiter down meet one obstacle after another . \\nfinally he sets up a final sting , but his superiors deny him the necessary money . \\nbeing frustrated , and against the reluctance of his new partner john vukovich ( bill pankow ) , he decides to get the money by robbing underworld courier . \\ntheir plan backfires with almost tragic consequences when their target turns out to be undercover fbi agent , but chance decides to carry out his scheme anyway . \\nlike french connection , one of his previous masterpieces , this friedkin\\'s movie was inspired by real life . \\ngerrald petievich , author of the novel that later served as basis for his screenplay , spent many years working as a secret service agent . \\nthat turned to be useful for the portrayal of that law enforcement agency , not much utilised by hollywood . \\nsecret service millieu was also cleverly used in order to bring the viewer into the decade of greed ; the beginning scene where the movie\\'s hero works as a part of presidential security detail is a nice opportunity to hear reagan\\'s speech that could illustrate the political and economical notions of those times . \\nultramaterialistic and egotistical view of the world is shared by almost any character in the movie . \\nwillem dafoe brilliantly portrays dangerous and intelligent psychopath , whose ruthlessness and lack of any moral fibber doesn\\'t seem like affliction in the reagan years ; on the contrary , those qualities actually makes masters socially acceptable . \\ncompared with him , and all the other side characters that want their \" piece of the action \" , two heroes on the side of law seem like losers . \\ninstead of being a classical good guy , secret service agent richard chance ( portrayed by william petersen in his most impressive role so far ) is nothing more than a lunatic whose adrenaline addiction and madness work against his better judgement ; his sidekick , who should serve as those \" better judgement \" is a weakling and sentimental fool that gets suckered in the end . \\nin such surroundings of moral decay , the not so happy , yet surprising ending doesn\\'t seem out of line ( although the very last shot leaves too much questions unanswered ) . \\nthe dark atmosphere of l . a . - city of glamour and moral decay - is nicely captured by william friedkin\\'s directing skills . \\nthe tight and realistic scripts with memorable characters ( portrayed by such capable actors like john turturro , dean stockwell , debra feuer , darlanne fleugel and steve james ) gave opportunity for friedkin to use another gimmick that made him famous in his 1971 masterpiece - great car chase . \\nthat scene alone , with lot of realism , thrills and surprise twists , is worth seeing the rest of the film . \\nthe soundtrack , provided by now almost forgotten band \" wang chung \" , is also one of the more memorable of that decade . \\nin every case , to live and die in l . a . is one of the rare movies in which hollywood actually tries to tell some unflattering truths about the world and succeeds in it . \\n',\n",

       " b\"synopsis : rumored to be about a true person , the story of mulan has circulated in oral tradition for over a thousand years , and has inspired operas , literature , and even coinage . \\n ( since 1984 , china has been issuing annual gold and silver coin sets commemorating famous historical figures ; the 1992 set includes mulan . ) \\nin the ballad of mulan ( written in the 5th or 6th century ) , an imperial edict by the khan ( emperor ) orders men from each family to be drafted into the army to defend china . \\na girl's parents hear sighing , and think that their daughter mulan ( the name means magnolia ) is dreaming of boys , but actually she's dreading what horrors might befall her old infirm father if he were to be drafted off to battle . \\nmulan bravely runs away , masquerading as a boy , to serve in the army instead of her father . \\nten thousand miles and twelve years of brutal war later , the army finally returns in triumph . \\nthe emperor wants to reward mulan's valor with a prestigious position in government , but she declines , accepts a horse , and returns home quietly to don her true clothes . \\nmulan's old army buddies visit and get the shock of their lives when they find out that mulan is actually a woman . \\nthe disney animated feature mulan is similar to the ballad story , only it adds a modern character for comic relief : mushu the dragon ( eddie murphy ) . \\nin disney's mulan , when a fierce army of invading huns threatens to overrun peaceful china the emperor orders one man from each family to be conscripted into the army . \\nold mr . fa ( soon-tek oh ) is handicapped and has no son ; he has only his spirited young daughter mulan ( ming-na wen ) . \\nfearing for her father's life , the courageous mulan secretly cuts her hair , disguises herself as a man , and sneaks off to serve in the army in her father's stead . \\nmeanwhile mushu , the disgraced and demoted guardian dragon of the fa family , has been reduced to the size of a squirrel and the status of incense burner . \\n ( his only duty is to ring a gong . ) \\nmushu hits upon a plan to redeem himself and regain his guardian status by helping the disguised mulan to become a macho male warrior hero . \\nwith the help of mushu , a horse , and a lucky cricket , can army recruit mulan save china and bring honor to the fa family ? \\nopinion : east meets west . \\ni know a chef in santa fe that does this sort of magic ; he combines asian culinary influences from the west coast with latin american from down south and european from the atlantic to concoct new creations that hit just the right combination of flavors . \\nfrom their state of the art animation studio in orlando , disney is hoping to work the same kind of east/west magic with mulan . \\ni mean , what would you say if i told you that a new movie featured tang dynasty art , with donny osmond singing , ming-na wen acting , and eddie murphy playing a chinese dragon that makes pop references to batman and the reverend jessie jackson ? \\nyet this is the case in the disney's re-interpretation of the familiar chinese classic . \\nthe end result is spectacular ; mulan is one of disney's best movies ever . \\npersonally , i'm also glad to see the detestable american stereotype of the weak-willed subservient asian woman take a beating : mulan is portrayed as a normal , if spirited , compassionate gal capable of taking the initiative . \\nmulan is more than just eastern graphics and faces combined with westernized pop and disney . \\nkids of any age will like the family themes , and will understand the good guys versus bad guys thing . \\nand adolescent and preteen girls can appreciate the romance factor , while the boys admire the battles . \\nand adults can admire those male/female nuances as well as the interplay between traditional notions of family , honor , and duty with industrial age notions of romantic love , gumption , and questioning . \\nbut even the tiniest details reveal quality . \\nthe movie's art supervisors spent three weeks in china researching the right look : negative spaces , positive detail , period clothing , and graphic designs typical of the time and place . \\ncomputers were used for crowd scenes of up to 30 , 000 people , and a special program called 'attila' was used for a spectacular sequence involving 2000 attacking huns on horseback . \\nand singers osmond and salonga are at the top of their game . \\nbalance is crucial . \\na movie about a chuckling lone dragon played by eddie murphy might not be disney's cup of tea , but if you use the character as a comic sidekick to balance a determined and spirited heroine , then , pow ! \\nthe dream team . \\nby the same token , a tale about a girl in the army might be a sober exercise in filial piety by itself , but toss the dragon in there and you've got enough wahoo individualism for a light hearted disney romp . \\nit's rare that a movie can seamlessly combine elements from both east and west , old and young , male and female into a cohesive and entertaining whole , but mulan hits the universal bullseye . \\nit's movie for any age , creed , gender , or color . \\n\",\n",

       " b'brian depalma needs a hit * really * badly . \\nsince scoring big with the untouchables in 1987 , depalma has seen casualties of war , raising cain and particularly the disastrous bonfire of the vanities go down in flames . \\nconsequently , it would be easy enough to consider carlito\\'s way a shrewd commercial choice for depalma , reteaming with al pacino ( scarface ) and returning to the gangland ground which has yielded his two greatest box office successes . \\nit doesn\\'t hurt any that he has latched on to a solid story and brought out dynamite performances from pacino and sean penn . \\ncarlito\\'s way , while hampered by depalma\\'s characteristic excesses and stylistic cannibalism , is a truly tense and engrossing drama . \\ncarlito brigante ( pacino ) is a life-long criminal who finds himself unexpectedly given a second chance . \\nin 1975 , carlito is released from prison after serving only five years of a thirty year sentence when his conviction is overturned on a technicality . \\nhe declares himself reformed , tired of life on the streets and determined to fulfill his simple dream of buying into a rental car business in the bahamas . \\namong those who find this conversion hard to believe are david kleinfeld ( penn ) , carlito\\'s crooked attorney and childhood friend , and bodyguard pachanga ( luis guzman ) . \\ncarlito rediscovers old flame gail ( penelope ann miller ) , and seems ready to retire in peace . \\nold ways die hard , though , and old associates pull carlito step by step back into a life he can\\'t seem to shake . \\ncarlito\\'s way will probably make the strongest impression with the two outstanding set pieces which bracket the film . \\nin the first , carlito accompanies his young cousin on a drug buy which will have anyone with a pulse on the edge of their seat ; the film closes with an equally thrilling chase through the new york subway and grand central station . \\nboth highlight depalma\\'s gift for choreographed mayhem , and these are not the only occasions when the stage blood flows freely . \\nyet for all the viscera , i found the character study even more compelling . \\ncarlito brigante has a lot of michael corleone in him , an aging gangster trying unsuccessfully to go legit . \\nbut where the culmination of the godfather saga played like opera , there\\'s more of an immediacy to carlito\\'s way , an ever-present sense of doom launched by the title sequence which sets the flashback story in motion . \\nyou sense that there\\'s no way , after so many years , that carlito can stay out of trouble . \\nindeed , he observes that his attempt at the straight life is more a function of time than a change of heart : \" you don\\'t get reformed ; you just run out of wind . \" \\npacino captures carlito\\'s dilemma with surprising subtlety and the cautious observation borne of years of experience watching every corner for an enemy . \\nsean penn is even better , turning in his best performance to date as kleinfeld . \\na jew in the world of puerto rican and italian wiseguys , kleinfeld is an outsider with a huge chip on his shoulder . \\nhe could have been simply pathetic , a heavy drinker and cocaine addict playing tough with guys way out of his league , but penn invests kleinfeld with tremendous nervous energy and an overwhelming survival instinct . \\nhe shows a man moving steadily towards the brink , making the moment he goes over quite jolting . \\nas compelling as the narrative is , viewers may experience a profound sense of deja vu . \\ndepalma continues to steal shamelessly from other directors , this time adding scorsese to his repertoire with a point of view tracking shot and a copacabana scene with more than passing resemblances to goodfellas . \\nhe even recycles some of his own previous plagiarisms , like a 360 degree swing around a kiss ( vertigo via body double ) and the climactic shootout which will strike many as far too reminiscent of the train station sequence from the untouchables . \\nfrom a story standpoint , there\\'s an obligatory love story with a cliche\\'d long-suffering girlfriend character . \\npenelope ann miller is a good but limited actor who doesn\\'t do anything new with the role , and eventually she becomes just a distraction , never integrated fully enough into the story . \\nstill , it\\'s easier to be forgiving of superficial flaws when the backbone is so solid . \\nthe two principle characters held an iron grip on my attention , one all the cinematic thievery in the world couldn\\'t break . \\ncarlito\\'s way plays like a tragic novel : deliberate , confident and powerful . \\nthose willing to grant depalma his tendencies towards the extreme should find themselves well- rewarded . \\n',\n",

       " b'in essence , good will hunting is an ordinary story told well . \\ntaken as a whole , there\\'s little that\\'s special about this tale -- it follows a traditional narrative path , leaves the audience with a warm , fuzzy feeling , and never really challenges or surprises us . \\nbut it\\'s intelligently written ( with dialogue that is occasionally brilliant ) , strongly directed , and nicely acted . \\nso , while good will hunting is far from a late-year masterpiece , it\\'s a worthwhile sample of entertainment . \\nlike scent of a woman , which was released around this time of the season five years ago , good will hunting is about the unlikely friendship that develops between a world-weary veteran and a cocky young man . \\nthe formula for the two films is similar -- both of the principals learn from each other as they slowly break down their barriers on the way to a better understanding of life and their place in it -- but the characters are different . \\nal pacino\\'s slade was a larger-than-life individual ; robin williams\\' sean mcguire is much more subtle . \\nand matt damon\\'s will hunting uses pugnaciousness to supplant the blandness of chris o\\'donnell\\'s charlie . \\nwill is a troubled individual . \\nas a child , he was the frequent victim of abuse . \\nan orphan , he was in and out of foster homes on a regular basis . \\nnow , not yet 21 years old , he has accumulated an impressive rap sheet . \\nhe has a short temper and any little incident can set him off like a spark in a tinder box . \\nbut he\\'s a mathematical genius with a photographic memory and the ability to conceive simple solutions to complex problems . \\nwhile working as a janitor at mit , he delights in anonymously proving theorems on the math building\\'s hall blackboards . \\nthen , one evening , his anonymity is shattered when professor lambeau ( stellan skarsgard ) catches him at work . \\nwill flees , but lambeau tracks him down . \\nunfortunately , by the time the professor finds him , will is in jail for assaulting a police offer . \\nthe judge agrees to release will under two conditions : that he spend one day a week meeting with lambeau and that he spend one day a week meeting with a therapist . \\neventually , once several psychologists have rejected the belligerent young man , sean mcguire , a teacher at bunker hill community college , agrees to take the case . \\nafter a rocky start , the two form a rapport and will begins to explore issues and emotions he had walled up behind impregnable armor . \\nand , as will advances his self-awareness in sessions with sean , he also learns about friendship from his buddy , chuckie ( ben affleck ) , and love from a harvard co-ed named skylar ( minnie driver ) . \\nthe script , by co-stars matt damon and ben affleck , is not a groundbreaking piece of literature , and occasionally resorts to shameless manipulation . \\nthe characters are well-developed , however , and there are times when the dialogue positively sparkles . \\nat one point , will comments that a session with sean is turning into a \" taster\\'s choice moment . \" \\nlater , will gives a brilliant , breathless diatribe against the nsa that has the rhythm of something written by kevin smith . \\n ( note : since smith co-executive produced good will hunting , it\\'s not out of the question that he had some input into this scene . ) \\ndirector gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , to die for ) culls genuine emotion from his actors , and this results in several affecting and powerful scenes . \\nthere\\'s an edginess to some of the sean/will therapy sessions , and the offscreen chemistry between matt damon and minnie driver ( who became romantically linked while making this film ) translates effectively to the movie -- the will/skylar relationship is electric . \\nlikewise , the companionability of damon and affleck is apparent in the easygoing nature of will and chuckie\\'s friendship . \\nmany of the individual scenes are strong enough to earn good will hunting a recommendation , even if the overall story is somewhat generic . \\nmatt damon , who recently starred as the idealistic young lawyer in the rainmaker , is solid ( although not spectacular ) as will . \\nminnie driver ( last seen in grosse pointe blank ) adds another strong performance to a growing resume ( and it\\'s refreshing that she was allowed to keep her british accent rather than having to attempt an american one ) . \\nthe outstanding performance of the film belongs to robin williams , whose sean is sad and wise , funny and somber . \\narguably the best dramatic work in the actor\\'s career ( alongside what he did in the fisher king ) , williams\\' portrayal could earn him a best supporting actor oscar nomination . \\nadequate support is provided by ben affleck ( chasing amy ) and stellan skarsgard ( breaking the waves ) . \\nlike most of what comes before it , the ending of good will hunting is completely predictable . \\nbut meeting expectations and following a familiar path aren\\'t always bad things in a movie , provided the film accomplishes those goals with a modicum of style and an attention to detail . \\ngood will hunting does both , and , as a result , earns a rating commensurate with the \" good \" in the title . \\n',\n",

\\nthat is the story covered in surprising detail by the insider . \\nthis all could have been enthralling , but it is not the sort of thing that a stylist like michael mann would be likely to do well . \\nand in the end , he failed . \\nto make a long story short , the film needed a director who knew how to make a long story short . \\nthe film opens with the cbs 60 minutes team in iran with the assignment to interview a terrorist . \\nwe get a taste for their personal style and how they get the upper hand . \\nthey go from being one newsman blindfolded at the hands of the terrorists to the actual interview with mike wallace ( played by christopher plummer ) . \\nthere the news team under producer lowell bergman ( al pacino ) are ordering around the terrorists and getting away with it . \\nthis seems to have nothing to do with the main line of the story , but later when the tobacco industry is so much harder to manipulate than committed terrorists , we have a wry irony on who really has clout in the world . \\nterrorists can grab the headlines , but the tobacco companies have the real position of power . \\nincongruously intercut with the iran interview sequence we see jeffrey wigand ( russell crowe ) dejectedly returning from work to his home . \\nwe discover that he has been fired and his career brought to a complete halt unexpectedly . \\nhe had been a very profitably rewarded vice-president in charge or research and development at brown and williams tobacco ; now he was unemployed and needed money to support his family . \\nrather than support him his wife liane ( diane venora ) demands of him what are they supposed to do for income . \\nmeanwhile the 60 minutes team trying to do a story on fires started by cigarettes have obtained some data they do not understand . \\nthey offer wigand $12 , 000 just to interpret the data . \\nwigand\\'s severance agreement swears him to secrecy about anything he knows about tobacco dealings , but he is reluctantly he stretches the severance terms . \\nhe is willing to read some documents from another tobacco company and interpret them for bergman . \\nin spite of the secrecy , wigand\\'s former employers seem immediately to know wigand is talking to 60 minutes and he is warned off by former boss thomas sandefur played michael gambon in an all too brief but deliciously sinister role . \\nand so the game begins . \\nwigand is irate at his negative treatment for what he still considered continued to be loyalty to his agreement and his former employer . \\nmeanwhile someone is playing very rough with wigand and his family . \\nthe film examines wigand and the pressures placed on his family as they are caught between two powerful giants . \\nwigand has always wanted to make tobacco safer and has natural sympathies with getting the story out . \\nhe and his family are assaulted psychologically and financially by the giant tobacco industry that had never lost a legal fight . \\nal pacino is given top billing but the wigand family is the core of the insider . \\nthe story is told slowly and in just a bit too much meticulous detail . \\nthe film is 157 minutes and is an extremely demanding film for the audience . \\nthe musical score by pieter bourke , lisa gerrard , and graeme revell is one of the worst in recent memory . \\nit puts ominous chords under some scenes and using voice in ways that become a distraction that gets in the way of the storytelling . \\nalso disturbing is the casting of christopher plummer as mike wallace . \\nplummer and wallace are such different types and wallace is too well-known for even so good an actor as plummer to play him convincingly . \\nthis film might have been a really engaging experience under another director\\'s control . \\nmichael mann was the wrong person to helm this film and the insider lacks intensity because of his style . \\ni rate it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \\n',\n",

       " b'pulp fiction , quentin tarantino\\'s anxiously awaited and superb follow-up to reservoir dogs , is absolutely and without a doubt progressing as one of the most talked about , loved , and hated films of all-time . \\nin all fairness , it should be noted that those who love this film greatly outnumber those who hate it . \\nas if reservoir dogs wasn\\'t perfect , tarantino went ahead and improved on perfection by creating pulp fiction , a fast-paced , hard talking , roller coaster ride of a movie that combines violence and extraordinary dialogue in a seemingly perfect way . \\nevery major character in this film is represented by a terrific acting performance by the actor . \\nto begin with , the two hit men : vincent vega ( john travolta ) and jules winnfield ( samuel l . jackson ) . \\nthese two characters work together perfectly , and the performances by each actor are nearly perfect . \\ntravolta , in fact , is still trying to get out of the vincent vega role . \\nif these two characters were not enough , there\\'s the struggling boxer butch coolidge ( bruce willis ) , the two small-time criminals pumpkin ( tim roth ) and honey bunny ( amanda plummer ) , the big man in charge marsellus wallace ( ving rhames ) and his attractive young wife mia ( uma thurman ) , and the \" problem solver \" himself , the wolf ( harvey keitel ) . \\nthese are just the major characters . \\nsmaller roles , but equally terrific , are handed to jimmie ( quentin tarantino ) , a young married man who gets caught up in some serious gangster business , lance ( eric stoltz ) , the far-out drug dealer , as well as maynard ( duane whitaker ) and zed ( peter greene ) , two hillbillies who are the men \" behind \" ( no pun intended for those of you who have seen this ) a very disturbing scene towards the end of the film . \\nthe film interweaves three stories that , at first , seem to be nothing alike but later prove to be very critical to each other . \\nthe film begins with pumpkin and honey bunny in a small coffee shop discussing their recent robberies and hold-ups . \\nthe two quickly decide to hold up the coffee shop , unknowing of what lies ahead . \\nafter this , the film focuses for some time on vincent and jules and their hit man lifestyle . \\nutilizing the films unforgettable dialogue , the two men discuss such things as hamburgers and foot massages before they bust into an apartment to terrorize the occupants . \\nthe two men were sent to the apartment to recover a mysterious briefcase for their boss , marsellus wallace . \\nafter basically toying with the men , especially the unfortunate brett ( frank whaley ) , vincent and jules complete their mission and recover the briefcase . \\nthis is not before a man jumps out from a bathroom with a . 357 \\n \" hand cannon \" , shooting at the two gangsters . \\nhe somehow completely misses them , leading jules to cite divine intervention . \\nthis is also the basis for more of the now-famous tarantino dialogue . \\nthe film then shifts to focus on boxer butch coolidge and his boxing escapades . \\nbutch was ordered to take a fall in his latest fight , but when he does not , marsellus vows to find him , wherever he is , and make sure that butch is not able to enjoy his new fortune . \\nvincent , meanwhile , has the honor of taking marsellus\\' wife , mia , out on a date while the big man is out of town . \\nvincent , obviously , is rather nervous about this , especially after hearing the tale about a man who was thrown out of a window for supposedly giving mia a foot massage . \\nafter their date , which seems to rather smoothly , things take a turn for the worst at the hands of vincent\\'s high-priced heroin , dubbed a \" monster \" by lance . \\neach story continually progresses , and new and amazing events occur . \\neventually , the stories all meet each other in the end , with pumpkin and honey bunny holding up the restaurant , which happens to contain both vincent and jules . \\npulp fiction is definitely one of the best films of the decade , and possibly of all-time . \\nalong with its superb dialogue , action , writing , directing , and acting , this film will not only latch onto you , but it proves that it does not want to release you until it has sunk its claws completely into you . \\nand with most fans of this movie , this is proved to be a rather easy task , although at times the graphic images , violence , and language may seem a bit overpowering . \\nsurely , quentin tarantino\\'s fame was greatly escalated by this film , and he proves not to be one who will fade from existence very soon . \\n',\n",

       " b'city of angels is the kind of love story that i enjoy the most : thought-provoking , moving , and completely unsentimental . \\ni find it interesting that this film has been released the same day as my giant , which is a film that is undone completely by its wretched sentimentality . \\ncity of angels is a wonderful film , enhanced by interesting and well-rounded characters and some of the most immersive imagery of the last couple of years . \\nit\\'s a love story that takes the familiar angel themes and makes them new and necessary to the story , and avoids most of the cliches we\\'re so used to seeing in films like this . \\ncity of angels is an apparently loose remake of wim wenders\\' 1988 film wings of desire . \\ni have yet to see wings of desire , so i am , unfortunately , unable to make a comparison of the two . \\ni have heard , however , that city of angels is dissimilar from the original in numerous ways , which makes me glad that this film isn\\'t a rip-off of its source material . \\nnicolas cage stars as seth , an angel who , like all of his angel counterparts , is present to lead the dying to heaven ( or somewhere just like it ) . \\none day , he is forced to take the life of a patient of dr . maggie rice ( meg ryan ) , and his attention is called to her . \\nthe angels can make themselves seen to humans , but they can\\'t experience any of the senses ( most importantly , touch ) . \\nhe shows himself to maggie , and she falls for him , unaware that he is slightly unavailable because of his apparition status . \\nseth wants to become human so he can feel her . \\nthat\\'s when he meets nathaniel messinger ( dennis franz ) , \" former celestial messenger and recent addition to the human race . \" \\n ( as a side note , i found messinger to be the most fascinating character , for i can only imagine how incredibly liberating it must be to live knowing what lies beyond death . ) \\nmessinger explains to seth that it is possible for angels to become human . \\nseth manages to convince maggie that he is an angel ( i know , it sounds ridiculous , but the scene in which she finds out is exceptionally well-done ) ; after much deliberation , she tells him that she could only be with a man who can feel . \\nthis , of course , is when seth decides to take the plunge ( literally ) from a building ; when he wakes up from the fall , he is human , and happy to feel what it\\'s like to have a split lip and blood oozing from his forehead . \\nsince i love this film so much , i\\'ll make a minor note that it certainly isn\\'t perfect . \\nalthough it is original and mesmerizing , it does fall prey to a few of the cliches of the genre . \\nthe plotting of the story by writer dawn steel is rather formulaic ( though the details are what make the story excellent , and steel has done a great job with them ) . \\nthe ending , too , could have been more powerful and less predictable . \\nthese elements are minor , though , and barely detracted from my overall enjoyment of city of angels . \\nthe acting is superb from everyone involved . \\nthis is perhaps my second-favorite performance from cage ( my favorite being the rock ) . \\nhe\\'s quiet and pensive , and his eyes are engaging when he speaks his softly-toned words . \\nhe\\'s perfect for a role like this , and at the same time he reassures us he\\'s not bound by playing the psycho ( though he is good at it , as he shows in face/off ) . \\nmeg ryan is a powerful , enticing , and appealingly-chirpy actress , and her work here is some of her best . \\ndennis franz , however , steals all of his scenes as the energetic former-angel . \\nwhat i admire most about city of angels is its overall presentation . \\ndirector brad silberling is a talented man , and he knows that a story like this is driven by the characters , rather than forced sentimentality . \\nhis direction is steady , and he shows this in just about every scene : near the beginning , maggie has to tell a mother and her two children that their father is dead . \\nthere is no music or elaborate camera work ; we simply see the reactions of the characters to the information . \\nthis is the way stories should be told , and the strength of scenes resonates more completely when the emotions are real . \\nthe film also appeals to the senses in a way that few love stories do . \\ncinematographer john seale ( the english patient ) provides some of the most stunning images i\\'ve seen on the big screen : hundreds of black-clad angels stand on a dim beach in the early morning hours ( just as an example ) . \\nthe music , by gabriel yared ( also of the english patient ) , is perfect for this film : it\\'s quiet and moody music ( but not sentimental ! ) , and adds to the atmosphere and tone nicely . \\nthe visual presentation of city of angels is easily the best of 1998 so far . \\nall of this adds up to a film that is instantly set apart from other members of this genre . \\nit\\'s a film that relies on character development and imagery to get the story across--the excellent actors and the professional production values make city of angels one of those rare films that both entertains and instigates thought simultaneously . \\n',\n",
       " b'pre-review note : seeing as the only concern of body shots is \" sex \" , i will be forced to refer to that particular act innumerable times throughout the duration of this review . \\nbecause of this , i will try to vary word descriptions of \" sex \" ( meaning if you are offended by pejorative terms , and \\\\ or your name is jerry falwell , you are kindly invited to hit the x up on the left corner of your screen ) , so if there happens to be a word you come across and cannot comprehend , fret not , it\\'s most likely just another way of referring to \" sex \" . \\ni think we\\'d all agree that any word used incessantly becomes a bit monotonous so i hope you appreciate my attempt to liven up what could potentially be a very boring review . \\nthough not as boring as the movie which makes steve forbes flat tax plan seem as lively as watching a naked mathew mconaughy play the bongos while high on god knows what . \\nbody shots is a film so frightened of coitus that scenes of copulation are filmed ominously , in the way you\\'d normally expect to see a violent attack . \\nit\\'s about people who think about screwing , seek it out , and talk about it . \\nthese are things we all do , sometimes . \\nthe characters in this film spend every waking moment pondering the simplicities of sexual acts . \\ntheir lives center around the next sexual encounter , but they seemed depressed . \\nit\\'s as if fucking is all they have to look forward to after a busy workweek . \\nat its core body shots is a message movie , the kind of thing i could picture really progressive church groups showing to middle schoolers in order to turn them off coition . \\nmichael cristoffer ( who directed gia , another film that treated bumping uglies as if it where evil ) is a moralist with nothing new to say . \\nhis characters don\\'t communicate anything of interest to each other , so cristoffer gives them an opportunity to let out their inner thoughts by speaking directly into the camera . \\nthey voice simplistic platitudes like \" i like to come \" or \" sex without love equals violence \" . \\nhuh ?

? ? alas , if it could only be that easy ? ? ? kidding of course ) , then , not only isn\\'t it erotic , it isn\\'t real . \\nit doesn\\'t feel like an authentic sexual encounter . \\nevery f * * k scene in this film ( and there are many ) is treated in the same unsexy manner . \\nbody shots makes fornication dirtier than the most scummy porno film . \\nit shows us none of the pleasure that should go along with it , and most of all , it fails to show us why its characters love making it so much if they seem to hate the act of actually doing it . \\nthe resulting search for nookie ( and you can take that cookie ? ? ? ) over one night leaves us with several tedious plot lines to follow . \\nthe main concern is much ado over a rape that may or may not have occurred . \\nthe film shows us two separate versions of the possible rape ( one where it is consensual the other where it is not ) and in both versions the young actress playing the possible victim gets her shirt torn off . \\nthis is a topic that could be interestingly explored if done intelligently , and if memory serves me i can\\'t think of one film that has done so , and yes i saw the accused which may be one of the most overrated movies of the 80\\'s next to wall street . \\nunfortunately nobody gives us reason to care , not the writer , the director or the actors nearly all of whom seem to have wandered off the set of a noxious 90210 spin off . \\npaul thomas anderson approached boogie nights in a manner similar to what cristoffer does here , though boogie nights succeeded . \\nit was similarly moralistic , but it gave us two different viewpoints ; it showed us how the lifestyle of porn enticed its characters , and it showed us the possible fall-out of such a decision . \\nthe characters in boogie nights were as idiotic as the characters are here , but anderson seemed to care about them . \\nhe gave them heart . \\ncristoffer gives them nothing but raging hormones . \\nhe preaches to us , by using his characters to preach to us . \\nthis is not the way to get any message across . \\nwhy not just direct a public service announcement on the perils of hittin\\' skins ?

       " b'david mamet has long been my favorite screenwriter and director . \\nwith his distinctive , more often than not ingenious dialogue , and his laid back style of direction nearly all of his movies are absolutely irresistible . \\nsome of them tend to be thickly layered , deceptive productions that require the audience to look at the film in a less superficial manner than the plot seems to require in order to discern its concealed message , or sometimes even a concealed storyline . \\nand although the real plot in his new project the winslow boy is slightly more conspicuous than in some of his other endeavors , it is still a brilliantly complex , consistently riveting motion picture about honor , about sacrifice , and about the difference between what is commonly known as justice and what is right . \\noh , and it\\'s rated g . \\nincidentally , this is the first time that mamet has decided to adapt someone else\\'s work ; namely a play by terrence rattigan , set in the 19th century . \\nhe casts nigel hawthorne in the lead role as arthur winslow , a rich , aging man who finds out that his 14 year old son ronnie has been kicked out of the naval academy for allegedly stealing a 5 shilling postal note . \\n \" did you do it ? \" he asks his boy . \\n \" no father , i didn\\'t , \" ronnie answers . \\nthat\\'s enough for arthur , who , with his oldest daughter ( rebecca pidgeon ) , immediately starts a crusade to bring his son\\'s case to court . \\nthey enlist the help of sir robert morton , a notorious attorney to help them achieve that formidably daunting task . \\nit all seems fairly frivolous , and no matter how you look at it , the winslow case is not the trial of the century . \\nbut arthur is determined to keep his family\\'s word clean and he is willing to go quite far to make sure of that . \\nsoon enough , sir robert morton along with the rest of the country becomes equally wrapped up in the proceedings . \\nso do we . \\nall david mamet does for the script is tighten and hone the dialogue , but his style is still fairly apparent . \\nthe characters still talk in his trademark staccatto lines and there is still tension present in conversations that no ordinary writer would be able to make tense . \\nbut this is not mamet\\'s norm , and it\\'s refreshing to see mamet deviate from his world of crooks , gangsters as con men , wonderful as those films were . \\nnigel hawthorne\\'s performance is nearly flawless . \\nhis delivery is that of a dignified yet not pompous man who seems to be getting beaten at his own game . \\nwe pity the man , but we also like him . \\nrebecca pidgeon , david mamet\\'s wife , who gave a fairly awful performance in the spanish prisoner is at the top of her game here as arthur\\'s oldest daughter , a flailing feminist who gives her all to the winslow case as a way for making up for her lack of success in the women\\'s suffrage movement . \\nthe winslow boy is a wonderful movie that avoids cliches such as a seemingly inevitable courtroom scene and shoots higher -- it wants to make a real impact rather than a phony one . \\nbe honest : did you feel anything profound at or after the courtroom scenes in films like a time to kill ? \\nif you wanted to but didn\\'t , this is a movie for you . \\nit is the epitome of subtlety : it\\'s powerful without being too emotional , sad without even trying to be depressing . \\ndavid mamet can churn out some great scripts , but in this movie he proves to those who ever doubted it once and for all that he is a hell of a director too . \\nhe is almost a national treasure . \\nhis films deserve their own genre . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n',\n",

       " b'here\\'s a word analogy : amistad is to the lost world as schindler\\'s list is to jurassic park . \\nin 1993 , after steven spielberg made the monster dino hit , many critics described schindler\\'s list as the director\\'s \" penance \" ( as if there was a need for him to apologize for making a crowd-pleasing blockbuster ) . \\nnow , after a three-year layoff , spielberg is back with a vengeance . \\nonce again , his summer release was special effects-loaded action/adventure flick with dinosaurs munching on human appetizers . \\nnow , following his 1993 pattern , he has fashioned another serious , inspirational christmas release about the nature of humanity . \\nthat film is amistad . \\nalthough not as masterful as schindler\\'s list , amistad is nevertheless a gripping motion picture . \\nthematically rich , impeccably crafted , and intellectually stimulating , the only area where this movie falls a little short is in its emotional impact . \\nwatching schindler\\'s list was a powerful , almost spiritual , experience . \\nspielberg pulled us into the narrative , absorbed us in the drama , then finally let us go , exhausted and shattered , three-plus hours later . \\naspects of the movie have stayed with me ever since . \\namistad , while a fine example of film making , is not as transcendent . \\nthe incident of the ship la amistad is not found in any history books , but , considering who writes the texts , that\\'s not a surprise . \\nhowever , the event is a part of the american social and legal fabric , and , while amistad does not adhere rigorously to the actual account , most of the basic facts are in order . \\nseveral , mostly minor changes have been made to enhance the film\\'s dramatic force . \\non the whole , while amistad may not be faithful to all of the details of the situation , it is true to the spirit and meaning of what transpired . \\none stormy night during the summer of 1839 , the 53 men imprisoned on the spanish slave ship la amistad escape . \\nled by the lion-hearted cinque ( djimon hounsou ) , they take control of the vessel , killing most of the crew . \\nadrift somewhere off the coast of cuba and uncertain how to make their way back to africa , they rely on the two surviving spaniards to navigate the eastward journey . \\nthey are tricked , however , and the la amistad , which makes its way northward off the united states\\' eastern coastline , is eventually captured by an american naval ship near connecticut . \\nthe kidnapped africans are shackled and thrown into prison , charged with murder and piracy . \\nthe first men to come to the africans\\' defense are abolitionists theodore joadson ( morgan freeman ) and lewis tappan ( stellan skarsgard ) . \\nthey are soon joined by roger baldwin ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a property attorney of little repute . \\naided by advice from former president john quincy adams ( anthony hopkins ) , baldwin proves a more persuasive orator than anyone gave him credit for , and his central argument -- that the prisoners were illegally kidnapped free men , not property -- convinces the judge . \\nbut powerful forces have aligned against baldwin\\'s cause . \\ncurrent president martin van buren ( nigel hawthorne ) , eager to please southern voters and 11-year old queen isabella of spain ( anna paquin ) , begins pulling strings behind-the-scenes to ensure that none of the africans goes free . \\nat its heart , amistad is a tale of human courage . \\ncinque is a heroic figure whose spirit remains unbreakable regardless of the pain and indignity he is subjected to . \\nhe is a free man , not a slave , and , while he recognizes that he may die as a result of his struggle , he will not give it up . \\neffectively portrayed by newcomer djimon hounsou , whose passion and screen presence arrest our attention , cinque is the key to viewers seeing the amistad africans as more than symbols in a battle of ideologies . \\nthey are individuals , and our ability to make that distinction is crucial to the movie\\'s success . \\nto amplify this point , spielberg presents many scenes from the africans\\' point-of-view , detailing their occasionally-humorous observations about some of the white man\\'s seemingly-strange \" rituals \" . \\nthe larger struggle is , of course , one of defining humanity . \\nas the nazis felt justified in slaughtering jews because they viewed their victims as \" sub-human , \" so the pro-slavery forces of amistad use a similar defense . \\nthe abolitionists regard the africans as men , but the slavers and their supporters see them as animals or property . \\nin a sense , the morality of slavery is on trial here with the specter of civil war , which would break out less than three decades later , looming over everything . \\namistad\\'s presentation of the legal and political intricacies surrounding the trial are fascinating , making this movie one of the most engrossing courtroom dramas in recent history . \\nfour claimants come forward against the africans : the state , which wants them tried for murder ; the queen of spain , who wants them handed over to her under the provision of an american/spanish treaty ; two american naval officers , who claim the right of high seas salvage ; and the two surviving spaniards from la amistad , who demand that their property be returned to them . \\nbaldwin must counter all of these claims , while facing a challenge to his own preconceived notions as the result of a relationship he develops with cinque . \\neven though attorney and client are divided by a language barrier , they gradually learn to communicate . \\naside from cinque , who is a fully-realized individual , characterization is spotty , but the acting is top-notch . \\nmatthew mcconaughey successfully overcomes his \" pretty boy \" image to become baldwin , but the lawyer is never particularly well-defined outside of his role in the la amistad case . \\nlikewise , while morgan freeman and stellan skarsgard are effective as joadson and tappan , they are never anything more than \" abolitionists . \" \\nnigel hawthorne , who played the title character in the madness of king george , presents martin van buren as a spineless sycophant to whom justice means far less than winning an election . \\nfinally , there\\'s anthony hopkins , whose towering portrayal of john quincy adams is as compelling as anything the great actor has recently done . \\nhopkins , who can convincingly play such diverse figures as a serial killer , an emotionally-crippled english butler , and richard nixon , makes us believe that he is adams . \\nhis ten-minute speech about freedom and human values is unforgettable . \\none point of difference worth noting between amistad and schindler\\'s list is this film\\'s lack of a well-defined human villain . \\nschindler\\'s list had ralph fiennes\\' superbly-realized amon goeth , who was not only a three-dimensional character , but a personification of all that the nazis stood for . \\nthere is no such figure in amistad . \\nthe villain is slavery , but an ideology , no matter how evil , is rarely the best adversary . \\nit is to spielberg\\'s credit that he has fashioned such a compelling motion picture without a prominent antagonist . \\namistad\\'s trek to the screen , which encountered some choppy waters ( author barbara chase-riboud has cried plagiarism , a charge denied by the film makers ) , comes in the midst of an upsurge of interest in the incident . \\nan opera of the same name opened in chicago on november 29 , 1997 . \\nnumerous books about the subject are showing up on bookstore shelves . \\nit remains to be seen how much longevity the amistad phenomena has , but one thing is certain -- with spielberg\\'s rousing , substantive film leading the way , the spotlight has now illuminated this chapter of american history . \\n',\n",
       " b'martin scorsese\\'s films used to intimidate me . \\nbecause of his reputation , i felt obligated to appreciate them as deep film art rather than as great flicks . \\nas much as i enjoyed them , i usually felt like i missed something . \\ni learned from scorsese\\'s casino that whatever techniques he uses are merely there to enhance the story . \\nno mystical interpretation is required to appreciate his movies . \\nfor example , in casino he uses subtitles when robert deniro and joe pesci are using code words with each other . \\nthere was no meaning more exotic than that subtitles were the most succinct way for him to tell the audience what was really going on . \\nor toward the end , when he uses three quick dissolves to compress a scene of a car backing away from a building . \\nagain , the simple , mundane explanation is that it helped the pacing . \\ni don\\'t mean to say that his techniques are not creative or good-looking . \\nbut he simply uses the best tool for the job . \\nit shouldn\\'t have surprised me , then , that kundun , a film about a mystical religion , actually turned out to be quite straightforward . \\nthe movie follows the life of the 14th dalai lama , the spiritual and political leader of tibet . \\nthe movie\\'s title is another name for the dalai lama which means \" ocean of wisdom . \" \\nhis story is told in strict chronological order and there are only a few cinematic visions to embellish the literal story . \\n ( one of which makes an interesting statement : pay attention to the film\\'s opening shot and watch where it is repeated . ) \\nwe first glimpse the dalai lama when he is two years old . \\nhis curiosity and self-assuredness capture the attention of a monk wandering in search of the new lama . \\na test is arranged to see if this boy really is the reincarnation of the 13 dalai lamas who have gone before . \\nseveral items belonging to the previous dalai lama are laid before the boy alongside some other items . \\nthe child is asked if he recognizes any of the items as his own . \\nthe boy picks correctly , proving that he is the new , and the old , dalai lama . \\nscorsese and long-time editor thelma schoonmaker were kind enough to allow the possibility that the child was taking his cues from the monk . \\nbefore selecting an item , he would look at the monk , perhaps for some sort of confirmation . \\nsometimes he picked right the first time , and sometimes he made a second choice . \\neither way , whether through reincarnation or quick human perception , the tibetans were assured of choosing a boy who could be a wise , perceptive leader . \\n>from this point on , the boy is raised as the reincarnation of the lama\\'s spirit and the future leader of a nation . \\nit is a great weight to put on the mind of a child . \\nin the u . s . it might be grounds for a call to social services . \\nbut the young lama accepts his destiny without any apparent emotional damage . \\nneither the great power nor the awesome responsibility keeps him from becoming a genuinely likeable , well-rounded person . \\ncertain patterns take shape over the years . \\nfor example , the dalai lama is fascinated by technology . \\nradios , clocks , and telescopes are some of his favorite toys . \\nwhen he is old enough to accept his leadership , he makes plans to modernize isolated tibet . \\nhe also has a soft spot for creatures who are suffering or in pain , including herd animals . \\nit\\'s nearly a running gag that he will buy sheep to keep them from being herded to slaughter . \\nbut the most ominous constant throughout his life is the presence and threat of tibet\\'s gigantic neighbor , china . \\ntibet and its leaders prove correct in fearing china , as , first the propaganda , then the political pressure , and finally the armies , come across their common border . \\nthe chinese invasion is so successful that the lama\\'s life is in danger if he stays . \\nthe movie ends when , after much agonizing , the dalai lama leaves tibet for india . \\nthe story doesn\\'t lead up to a cinematic climax as strongly as most feature films do . \\nit just doesn\\'t fit that mold . \\nif it were forced into such a shape it would have been a completely different movie ( perhaps more like seven years in tibet , which is good in its own right ) . \\nthe pacing of kundun is more calm and level than that . \\nthe structure of the film is made to fit the characters and events , not vice-versa . \\nperhaps because the pace is slower , we have more time to notice the beautiful art , vestments , and architecture of tibet . \\na mandala , ( tibetan sand painting ) with beautiful , vibrant colors is shown throughout the movie . \\nthe robes and hats of state are bright red and gold . \\nthe bricks are a rich reddish brown , not unlike the skin tone of the tibetans . \\neven the touchstone pictures logo before the movie ( which is usually light blue ) is the red and gold of tibet . \\nphilip glass composed the music for kundun , and he was the perfect choice . \\nfor those who don\\'t know of glass , his music is like a tibetan mandala . \\nhis building blocks are lots of small notes , tiny grains of music , which are first grouped , then repeated in patterns . \\nthese patterns create interesting textures which are themselves part of a larger composition . \\npeople won\\'t be flocking to kundun for it\\'s great ending , or talking about its outstanding plot , but it does have a lot to offer : an interesting lifetime , exotic sights , rich cinematography , and innovative music . \\nit gives interesting insight into tibetan buddhism and takes a warm look at the dalai lama as a person . \\non top of it all is the cinematic mastery of martin scorsese , who gives the film a strong , beautiful , consistent look . \\n',\n",
       " b'written by alex cox , tod davies , terry gilliam and tony grisoni \\ndirected by terry gilliam \\ni\\'ve always preferred mushrooms to blotter acid . \\ndropping acid is like riding a roller coaster blindfolded ; you have no idea where the peaks and valleys are , no idea when the next terrifying decent will send your stomach into your throat , and no idea how long the ride will last . \\nthen there\\'s the hard knot in your gut and the clenched teeth that come with ingesting a strychnine-laced dose . \\nmushrooms , on the other hand , offer the psychedelic equivalent of a leisurely ride on a ferris wheel : a steady , reassuring assent , a short period of thrilling motion and color , and then a smooth landing . \\nacid is for daredevils ; mushrooms are for refined seekers of joy . \\nmy point is that in fear and loathing in las vegas , director terry gilliam has made an acid movie , when i wish he would have made a mushroom movie . \\nfull of shocking sight gags , aggressive images and grotesque comic performances , the film certainly offers something for those fans of hunter s . thompson\\'s book who want to experience its twisted pharmacological world-view from the inside out . \\nbut for those of us who just want to enjoy a well-made film , gilliam has produced a mixed bag . \\nfear and loathing tells the ostensibly true story of how self-professed \" gonzo \" journalist hunter s . thompson ( johnny depp ) and hispanic activist attorney oscar zeta actosta ( benicio del toro ) , came to las vegas to cover a motorcycle race and found themselves trapped in the middle of a district attorney\\'s convention while ingesting every conceivable drug available to a man of means in 1971 . \\noperating under the pseudonyms of \" raoul duke \" and \" dr . \\ngonzo \" , the two men careen into vegas on an acid and mescaline bender , then hole up in a hotel suite to binge on amyl nitrite , cocaine , tequila and a rainbow of multi-colored uppers and downers . \\nthey terrorize every one they meet , mostly because every one they meet terrifies them . \\nduke hallucinates giant bats on the way into town , then is attacked by horrifying lizards in the casino lounge . \\ndr . gonzo becomes enamored of a thick-bladed hunting knife and begs duke to throw the tape player into the bathtub with him just as jefferson airplane\\'s \" white rabbit \" reaches its climax . \\nand these guys don\\'t just trash hotel rooms - they rape them , humiliate them and leave them for dead . \\nthat neither of them ends up dead or in jail is testament to blind luck or providence , depending on your point of view . \\nthompson\\'s book , besides being a hilarious read , has stood the test of time as an important historical document . \\nit simultaneously exposed the 60\\'s drug culture for the sham that it was and exposed las vegas as the place where the american dream came to die . \\npontificate all you want about how the film illustrates thompson\\'s message , but the truth is that , stripped to its bare essentials , what gilliam has wrought is a drug comedy . \\nit\\'s a cheech and chong movie . \\nyou\\'re there to watch depp and del toro ingest a lot of chemicals and then laugh at the results : see johnny take drugs , see johnny fall down . \\nthere\\'s nothing wrong with this concept , but gilliam tries too hard . \\nthis is a frantic movie - all sweaty close-ups , wide-angle lenses , dutch tilts and other-worldly lighting schemes . \\nthere are times when gilliam really does put a convincing representation of an acid trip on the screen . \\nbut to what end ? \\nmuch of the dialogue comes verbatim from thompson\\'s book , and there are some priceless comic observations . \\nbut you\\'re hard pressed to hear or digest them amidst all the jumbled camera work . \\nthis brings us to the performances , which strike me as all wrong . \\ndepp plays thompson as groucho marks filtered through george c . scott in patton - a gimmicky performance which works against the biting satire of thompson\\'s dialogue . \\nin between his several puking scenes , del toro fares better as dr . gonzo , but he also mumbles and sputters so many of his lines that their weight is lost . \\nwatching these two made me wish that the movie had been made twenty years ago , with dan akroyd and john belushi as the leads - now that would have been something to see . \\nit\\'s interesting to note that alex cox , credited as a co-writer on the screenplay , was originally slated to direct before gilliam took over . \\nas much of a fan as i am of gilliam\\'s work , cox would have been the better choice . \\nsid and nancy , cox\\'s best work , covered essentially the same subject matter , but cox was able to pull back and allow the characters of sid vicious and nancy spungen to carry the film . \\ngilliam commits the compound sin of over-directing his film while being uncertain of his purpose . \\nwhat kind of movie was he trying to make , anyway ? \\nit doesn\\'t try to be a cautionary tale , and it doesn\\'t work as broad comedy . \\nif he had considered more carefully his purpose , the result would have been a much more interesting film . \\nbut i don\\'t want to be too hard on it . \\nthere are some truly funny moments , and if you\\'re in a good enough mood you might get a kick out of it . \\ni do , however , recommend watching fear and loathing in las vegas under the influence of your favorite controlled substance - i guarantee it will enhance the effect . \\n',\n",

       " b'the opening crawl tells us that the galaxy is in turmoil over the taxation of trade routes , and the greedy trade federation has used it\\'s armada of powerful space battleships to blockade the planet naboo . \\nwe soon find that the federation plans to invade the planet with an enormous army of warrior robots and force naboo\\'s ruler , the young queen amidala ( natalie portman ) to sign a treaty giving the federation control . \\nhowever , the galactic republic has sent jedi knights qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) as emissaries to the federation in order to negotiate for the ending of the blockade . \\nno sooner do they arrive than the federation leaders are instructed via holographic transmission by a mysterious cloaked figure to destroy the jedi , and the first battle begins . \\nit seems that for me and thousands of people like me , the love for george lucas\\'s trilogy of star wars movies has only grown over time . \\nwe\\'re the fans , not the freaks . \\nwe won\\'t go dressing up like darth vader ( although you have to admit those imperial uniforms are pretty darn cool ) , and we won\\'t incorporate lines from the script in our everyday conversations ( not all the time , anyway ) , but if someone wants to challenge us to a little trivia contest , we\\'re throwing down . \\nall right , stop looking at me like that . \\nwe have been faithfully and patiently waiting . \\nwaiting for this movie ever since the end credits of return of the jedi started to roll . \\nyou see , the trilogy is not just a set of movies , but a religion of sorts to we , the faithful disciples , and the phantom menace is tantamount to the second coming of the messiah . \\nunfortunately , it is not our savior . \\nfor weeks beforehand , i was going around telling people that this movie had better be damned good - stupendously good - miraculously good . \\nanything less and it\\'ll be the biggest disappointment of the century . \\ni didn\\'t want the doomsaying prophecy to come true , really i didn\\'t , but this film nevertheless fails to reach the pinnacles of filmmaking . \\ncharacter development is virtually nonexistent . \\nwith the possible exception of qui-gon , most of the film\\'s characters seem left with nothing to do but go through the motions . \\nnone seem very affected by their experiences , and few even show any passion at all . \\ncontrast this with the horribly irritating comic relief we are nearly continuously subjected to in the form of jar jar binks , a creature belonging to a race which lives in underwater cities on naboo , in precarious symbiosis with the land dwellers led by amidala . \\njar jar\\'s life is saved by qui-gon early in the film , and travels with our heroes for the sole reason of making us laugh ( or supposedly so ) . \\nhis speech mannerisms are so \" cute-ified \" that i couldn\\'t understand a third of what he was saying , and the slapstick he performed was just distracting . \\nhis head gets caught in an electronic field , his foot gets caught in the stirrup of some large beast , he describes being in trouble as \" deep doo doo , \" and even manages to step in some of the same while walking around in mos eisley spaceport . \\ntherein lies a key difference between this film and one of its predecessors . \\nin star wars , we had obi-wan telling us mos eisley was a \" wretched hive of scum and villainy . \" \\nin the phantom menace , we get doo doo . \\nthe films of the trilogy took me away from my everyday life and immersed me in a story \" a long time ago in a galaxy far , far away . . . . \" \\nthis film , on the other hand , constantly reminds me that it\\'s only a movie by including situations and phrases that are so uniquely modern american that they seem incredibly out of place and serve to jerk the viewer from the experience . \\nperhaps the most blatant offense occurs during a scene where young anakin skywalker enters into a pod racing competition ( it\\'s kind of like chariot racing with large engines instead of horses ) , and there are a couple of commentators in a press box delivering indy 500-like play by play . \\ni liked the pod race ; it was really exciting and ratcheted the tension , but when the heck did lucas think up the idea of putting in the sportscasters ? \\nthe race would have been even more exciting without the distraction . \\nthis aspect , coupled with the emphasis on humor simply baffled me . \\ni suppose one may say that lucas was trying to appeal to the younger viewer , but would more intelligent scenes and dialog hurt this appeal at all ? \\ndidn\\'t millions of youngsters still go back to see the original star wars in 1977 over and over again ? \\ndidn\\'t the action figures still sell like hotcakes ? \\nof course they did , and it\\'s only poor judgment that allows the most-eagerly awaited film in history to be marred by pandering to children who would still have enjoyed a film with more appeal for adults . \\none aspect that will appeal broadly , however , is the use of special effects . \\nthe people at lucas\\'s industrial light and magic , the world\\'s premiere effects house , outdid themselves in providing seamless integration of computer-generated images and real-life footage . \\nsome of the scenes have to be seen to be believed , especially the shots of a land battle between the federation\\'s robot army and jar jar\\'s countrymen . \\nthe space battles are also impressive , although improved over past efforts by only subtle margins to the casual observer . \\nthis , however , is a testament to the work which ilm produced two decades ago and still holds up well today . \\njohn williams is back , of course , providing a score for the film as only he can . \\nhis music is pervasive throughout , as rousing and as dramatic as ever , always serving to punctuate scenes noticeably and appropriately . \\nsince this film is supposed to be the first installment in a nine-episode story ( star wars , the empire strikes back and return of the jedi being episodes four , five and six , respectively ) , the phantom menace has the daunting task of setting up the origins of several characters we know already , in addition to those with whom we unfamiliar . \\nas a result , attention to history and characterization was spread a little thin . \\nit would have been nice to get more in depth with yoda and obi-wan , for example , but given the fact that there were several new characters to cover , it is understandable that some of the development has been left for the next two films . \\none of the new characters is darth maul , hailed as the new villain with as much hype as marketing forces could muster prior to this film\\'s release . \\nin spite of the hype , darth maul is a character which almost didn\\'t have to be in the film , his role is so insignificant . \\nhe has maybe three spoken lines ( believe it or not , a second actor voices the character ) and the rest of the time just scowls and looks mean . \\nwith that working against him , he never has a chance at being interesting and instead ends up an utter disappointment . \\nlucas seems to have wanted to develop the spiritual nature of the star wars universe , something which has been prominent throughout . \\nhowever , he does so largely by paralleling the star wars spirituality with the bible , offering an easy out for story-writing and once again bringing the viewer back to planet earth with a real-life connection . \\noddly , while trying to capitalize on spirituality , lucas at the same time introduces the fact that mastery of the force is dependent upon having little force-loving parasites in your body\\'s cells . \\nthis only serves to de-mystify the workings of the force a few notches by offering a scientific connection . \\ndon\\'t let me mislead you too far . \\nthe phantom menace , by most standards , is a good film . \\nit contains a lot of visual treats , sets the stage for an epic story , gives us a bit of excitement here and there , and even allows us to revisit some of our old friends . \\nit\\'s just that when held up to it\\'s predecessors ( and to not do so would be unrealistic ) , this film simply pales . \\n',\n",

\\nbecause in bad movies , nauseated women are always pregnant . ) \\nthe fourth member of their party is erica , a wiccan with flowing hair and wide eyes who wants to prove that the blair witch was a good witch , not evil . \\nthey pick up the fifth and final team member in a cemetery . \\nkim is dressed completely in black , has extreme goth-style makeup on , and occasionally displays seemingly psychic abilities , but otherwise seems to be the most intelligent and reasonable person out of the entire bunch . \\npresumably she wanted to be picked up in the cemetery just for dramatic effect ; it\\'s never explained . \\nthe party of five heads off into the woods as promised . \\nthey reach the crumbling ruins of the foundation of rustin parr\\'s house and set up camp , complete with extensive video equipment with which to record the night\\'s events . \\nthere is a brief encounter with a rival blair witch tour group who had planned to camp at that site as well , but after a few words are exchanged , the rival group huffs off and makes camp elsewhere . \\nthe movie veers off at this point to spend many long , long minutes showing the drinking party that ensues after the sun goes down . \\nsexual innuendoes are tossed around , much hard liquor , beer , and pot is consumed , and nothing much else happens . \\nthis would be a great point to get up and go to the bathroom if necessary . \\nthe next day , the team wakes up and discovers that their camera equipment has been completely trashed , and that steven and tristen\\'s manuscript paper is fluttering down from the sky in shreds , like snow . \\nthe videotapes are missing , but thanks to a psychic intuition from kim , they discover the videotapes buried underneath the foundation of the house , \" right where the original blair witch tapes were found ! \" \\nooh . \\nspooky . \\nthe team goes back to jeffrey\\'s house -- a creepy old civil war-era warehouse in the heart of the woods -- to regroup and review the tapes . \\nthey soon discover that the tapes mysteriously skip five hours of the night . \\nwacky hijinks ensue . \\ntristen starts having weird dreams in which she is the blair witch , everybody starts finding these weird rune-like burn marks on their bodies , steven and erica have some highly disturbing mutual hallucinations , and everything pretty much goes to hell in a handbasket . \\nthroughout the entire ordeal , jeffrey and the others continue to scrutinize the videotapes , which seem to have some kind of weird images on them at about the point that the time jumps ; eventually tristen wanders in , mutters something about \" reverse , \" and from this they somehow realize that they have to play the tapes backwards . \\nwhen they do this , they discover what really happened during the five lost hours . \\n ( one of the things they see on the videotape is footage of themselves burying the videotapes . \\nokay , if the videotapes were being buried , then how were they recording themselves . . . oh , \\nnevermind . ) \\nthis movie was awful . \\nsimply awful . \\nthe characters are broadly-drawn caricatures that are never allowed any depth or development . \\nerica is the nature-loving wiccan . \\ntristen is the weak and sympathetic woman . \\nsteven is the overbearing asshole . \\nkim is the antisocial goth girl . \\nold , tired cliches were used to illustrate these caricatures . \\nhow do we know tristen is weak and sympathetic ? \\nbecause she\\'s pregnant ! \\nhow do we know kim is an antisocial goth girl ? \\nbecause she wears a lot of eye makeup ! \\nhow do we know the local sheriff is a bad guy ? \\nbecause he has jagged teeth and talks like he\\'s straight out of \" deliverance \" ! \\nthis is weak storytelling at its worst . \\nrather than taking the time to flesh out the characters and make them truly sympathetic , the writer chose to give each one a few stereotypical characteristics , in an attempt to use some cinematic shorthand and thereby skip straight to the action . \\nit didn\\'t work . \\non top of being poorly developed , most of the characters were either seriously unlikable or patently stupid . \\n ( \" honey , you just had a miscarriage out in the woods and got medical attention at a hospital that looks like it belongs in a bad slasher movie . \\nlet\\'s get on a plane home . \" \\n \" no . \\ni am having these bizarre nightmares and seeing strange visions and i want to find out what\\'s going on . \" \\n \" ok . \" ) \\nfrankly , by the end of the movie , i was rooting for the witch . \\ni also felt that there was simply too much blood \\'n\\' gore in this film . \\nthe first movie worked by never showing us the horror . \\nthe witch was a palpable presence in that movie , but we never saw it ; we never saw anything , in fact . \\nthe horror was all off-screen , and thus our imaginations worked overtime to envision what it might possibly be . \\nthis is the hallmark of a truly creepy and disturbing horror movie . \\nblair witch 2 dispensed with such niceties and went straight for the gross-out . \\nthis was evident from the opening scenes of the mad doctors forcing white goo down jeffrey\\'s throat , and continued throughout the film as the audience is treated to occasional confusing and disorienting footage of what appears to be a ritual massacre of some sort . \\nknives plunge into flesh , bloody fingers trail off into the darkness , and none of it is explained until the very end , when it was too late for me to care . \\nthis movie didn\\'t stop with showing us the gore , either ; it went for broke and showed us everything . \\nby the end of the movie , there are no questions remaining about the missing five hours . \\nit is all explained ; in fact , it is all shown on-screen in loving detail . \\ni confess to being someone who prefers horror movies in which you never see the monster , or see only brief glimpses , mere suggestions of what the monster is ; it is not because i find the monster so terrifying , but because i find the absence of the monster to be infinitely more terrifying . \\ni have seen interviews with the director in which he suggested that there is no \" monster , \" that all of the evil was perpetrated only by the human mind . \\ni found this to be a miserably poor explanation ; if it was in fact the director\\'s intent , then he needs to have some words with the writer , because it was not made clear at all . \\n ( i know a lot of people who like to go to parties and get drunk and stoned out of their minds ; none of them has ever gone on a murderous rampage and then experienced mass hallucinations with a group of other people for the next week or so . \\nand if there was no witch , then what about the vanishing tree ? \\nthe snowfall of manuscript paper ? \\nhm ? ) \\nblair witch 2 : book of shadows was a horrible movie . \\nfrom the poorly-written characters to the implausible story to the plot inconsistencies to the gross-out shots , it was a bad effort through and through . \\n',\n",

       " b'let me open this one with a confession : i love cop movies . \\ni adore them with such an unwavering , near foolish passion that i was actually one of the first in line to see 1998\\'s one tough cop starring the smirkiest of the baldwin brothers , steven . \\nwas it any good ? \\nwell , just about as good as baldwin\\'s steven seagal impression ( for those i\\'ve confused the answer is a resounding no ! ) . \\nnow let me clarify , i don\\'t love just any cop movie ; i\\'m not too keen on the smug buddy cop flicks that were so in vogue in the 80\\'s and now slowly ( gulp ) returning thanks to jackie chan and chris tucker . \\ni\\'m partial to those gritty , earthy cop dramas like serpico , donnie brasco , and the french connection . \\nproblem is these films come along just about as often as george w . bush makes a cogent point so whenever a \" true \" cop movie does hit multiplexes , i come running towards it like an eager puppy ? ? ? and inevitably i leave , head bowed , tripping over my squiggly tail . \\nso what is it about cop movies that transform me into a moron willing to shell out $7 . 50 for a movie called one tough cop ( which actually sounds a lot like a wiseguy spin-off , no ? ) ? \\ntruth is i\\'m a sucker for those barren streets , that gritty , graffiti strewn modernist jungle where dangerous criminals lurk and cops , like modern day knights , must shield us from their iniquitous clutches . \\nyes it\\'s all very corny and awfully boys clubish , which , i\\'m guessing , is precisely where these feelings come from . \\nas little tots us boys are brought up to create our own wars with gi joe\\'s , enact cops and robbers or cowboy and indian fantasies , etc . the best gritty cop films tap into those gleeful adolescent fantasies , and heighten them , turning it all into an existential nightmare of thin moral lines and psychological chaos . \\nas an adult my tastes haven\\'t changed all that drastically ; sure i can get a cerebral high from the emotional complexities of a krzysztof kieslowski film , but i still delight at the promise a \" guy \" film could potentially bring . \\nnow what if it\\'s the cops who\\'re the corrupt ones ? \\nooh that one really gets me going , these protectors using all that at their service , taking advantage of others for their own gain . \\nthrow a courtroom drama ( yech ! ) \\ninto the pot and you have the tremendously absorbing sidney lumet film prince of the city . \\nhow absorbing is prince of the city , you ask ? \\nso damn absorbing that when the film shifts from gritty undercover cop drama to courtroom drama ( a sub-genre i loath the way kristy swanson must loath sarah michelle gellar ) i remained completely and utterly involved . \\nthe film stars treat williams , who gives the kind of performance that should have skyrocketed his career up to the level that brad pitt currently resides at . \\nsince i was hatched a mere two years prior to the release of prince of the city , i cannot provide an answer as to why it didn\\'t . \\n ( though judging from his recent roles in tripe like deep rising and dead heat i would guess that it probably has something to do with quite a few bad career moves ) . \\nlike mickey rourke and eric roberts ( both of whom are currently doing time in direct to video purgatory ) williams is a talented leading man who didn\\'t make it to where he should have . \\n ( if there was any justice in this dog gone world keanu reeves would be the one banished to direct to video hell ) . \\nhere , the actor is given a role not all that dissimilar from al pacino\\'s in serpico ( also directed by lumet ) . \\nwilliams plays danny ciello , a member of an elite squad of police officers who take down drug dealers on the gritty pre-juliani streets of new york . \\nthey work without uniforms or hours much like paid vigilantes . \\nand that analogy is more than apt seeing as how the bunch are kinda sorta forced into using corrupt means to get the job done . \\nthe squad relies entirely on informants ( low level junkies ) to gain access to the big wigs , and in order to obtain the info they seek , they sometimes have to provide the junkies with the junk of their choice . \\ndanny has done this , and though he\\'s a fairly honorable guy , who took the job in order to do good , his intentions have gotten a bit skewed along the way . \\nhe seeks redemption and concludes that the best way to go about getting it is by talking to internal affairs who then convince him to go undercover as a \" double agent \" . \\nhe does so with one condition : he will not rat on his partners . \\nright away we know that that is exactly what he\\'ll have to do . \\nand watching the movie build to that is thrilling in the way that any great character driven story can be . \\nundercover cop films are almost innately exciting , even the kind that pull out all the cliches ( like in too deep ) . \\nhow can one not be moved by the issues of betrayal , ambiguity , and the danger in putting oneself in such a risky position ? \\nprince of the city takes all this and charges it with a perceptive , hard boiled script and taut unintrusive direction by old pro sidney lumet , as well as a handful of intense performances , most notably by treat . \\nlumet\\'s greatest contribution to the movie is how he lays back , and lets the camera soak up the action . \\nhis scenes transition rapidly from one to the next building layers of tension , and he rarely holds for reaction shots , instead he clicks away at precisely the moment a character stops yakking . \\nlumet\\'s worst tendency is one that many film makers ( especially oliver stone ) tend to overuse : he relies a little too heavily on actors shouting their lines at each other presumably in order to ratchet up the tension . \\nthis isn\\'t as much a problem here as it was in night falls on manhattan , lumet\\'s most recent cop \\\\ lawyer endeavor , a movie that nearly gave me an ulcer from just watching . \\nthough of late lumet has made several really awful career choices ( maybe he and treat should get together for a drink or something ) , the most recent a completely unnecessary remake of gloria , here he was on , sustaining tension in a film that runs for 167 minutes with not one dull spot . \\nsome of the formula pictures i like the best are the most simplistic . \\nhollywood often forgets how easy it is to make these kinds of pictures even tolerable . \\nof course cop movies aren\\'t popular anymore ( yes buddy cop flicks are popular but those are more like extended sitcoms with gunfire amid the punch lines ) , but just look at the average hollywood action movies , flicks so bloated and full of unnecessary fat like the boring love interest that serves no purpose other than to stall the action and demonstrate that our hero isn\\'t gay , the lame comic relief character who\\'s never funny , and on and on . \\nfor all its moral ambiguities prince of the city is a back to the basics cop \\\\ courtroom drama that leaves out all the crap and really thrills . \\nit focuses completely on its story , and its characters all of whom are completely believable from the cops to the lawyers to the junkies . \\nthere\\'s a great scene early on where an irate williams shouts at an ia officer and looks as if he\\'s about to go into one of those corny braveheart inspirational speeches , but instead he breaks down in front of the cop and begins sobbing . \\nthis is a scene that would never make it into a michael bay film ( even though bruce willis sacrifices his life at the end of armageddon , not one damn tear ) it would be cut out because the director would say oh that makes him too human , excuse me , weak . \\nin the very next scene danny speaks in a hushed raspiness , straining to get the words out . \\nhe\\'s lost his voice . \\ndoes that little itty bitty detail matter ? \\nmaybe not to most , but it sure made my night . \\nand in a sprawling epic of corruption , greed , betrayal and violence it\\'s nice to see that someone is paying attention to the little things . \\n',\n",

       " b'perhaps the most dramatic changes in the motion picture industry in this decade have to do with special effects . \\nthere is no question that action-adventure and science-fiction/action movies are now judged by the character of their light and noise . \\nwhereas classic adventure pics of the last twenty years , such as raiders of the lost ark , were made in grand traditional fashion ; contemporary films like jurassic park are multimillion-dollar creations of computer technology . \\nthe latest in this visually awesome series of movies , the wachowski brothers\\' the matrix , is a testament to the skilled use of special effects and its ability to enhance a movie\\'s story . \\nunlike many sci-fi movies which promote themselves as effects-heavy blockbusters but fail to deliver on that promise , the matrix is a carefully constructed special effects event . \\nit runs 135 minutes in length and employs a countless number of computerized tricks which range from gimmick to grandiose , and the quality of the effects remains constant throughout the film\\'s length . \\ncontrary to popular trend , the matrix commits itself to being a spectacle of light and sound . \\nin this regard , the movie is something like a card sharp . \\nwith its flashy mass stripped away , the matrix would be quite shallow and untalented . \\nthe script is characteristically weak , and the dialogue suffers in lieu of a far more innovative visual approach . \\nbut , like the card sharp , the matrix wows its audience to such a high degree that actual content is irrelevent . \\nthe viewers don\\'t care about what the matrix has to say as long as the next special effects sequence is right around the corner . \\nand right around the corner they usually are , for the script tells a fast-paced , albeit frequently revisited story . \\nas the movie explains , the world as we know it is nothing but an elaborate computer program constructed by an artificial intelligence for the purpose of placating mankind . \\nbillions of human beings lie in this dormant state while the intelligence -- the matrix -- \" farms \" our life energy . \\nonly a select group of individuals knows of the \" real \" world , and a particularly ingenious squad of these rebels is led by ultra-cool morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) . \\nmorpheus and his crew recruit a computer expert named neo ( keanu reeves ) , believing he is a prophesied individual who will help them overthrow the matrix and return peace to earth . \\nthe cast plays out this story in stylish fashion . \\nthe set design is very dynamic , running the gambit between cramped and dreary to bright and airy . \\nthe costumes , as well as the actors who wear them , add to the roles . \\nfor instance , the manifested antagonists in the movie , a group of \" agents \" created by the matrix in its computer program , all dress in matching secret servicewear ; the rebel fighters , on the other hand , dress in rich hues of leather . \\nthe casting cannot be criticized , for the typically stoic reeves isn\\'t required to say much and laurence fishburne gets plenty of time to be so damn cool . \\nsupports in carrie-anne moss , joe pantoliano , and hugo weaving are all effectual . \\none of the best comparisons to thw matrix is last year\\'s science fiction masterpiece dark city , particularly if one ponders how this same premise would\\'ve worked from a different approach . \\nthe alex proyas film was far more dark and introspective , requiring a bit of thought before themes became clear ; here , the wachowski brothers have managed to construct a thrill-ride motion picture with little abandon and much noise . \\nthe better picture between the two depends on the viewer , but the key to the success of the matrix is that the noise did not get in the way of the fun . \\n',\n",
       " b'a movie laced with a good blend of action , comedy , and a heavy dose of musical celebrity guest appearances sounds pretty gourmet , but even the best ingredients can be thrown together in the wrong way , creating a dismal and unsatisfactory product . \\neighteen years after the blues brothers hit theaters , blues brothers 2000 is being unleashed , minus half of its original duo ( the late john belushi ) and nearly all of its original charm . \\ndan aykroyd reprises his role ( as well as his co-writing credit ) as elwood blues , the sharp dressed con man who wreaked havoc on a self-proclaimed \" mission from god \" along with his brother jake and their blues brothers band nearly eighteen years ago . \\nas we begin , elwood is being released from a state penitentiary along with the news of his brother\\'s death in prison years ago . \\ncompletely on his own , elwood decides to trace his roots back to the orphanage where he spent his childhood , only to discover that everyone he has ever known has passed away . \\nbut elwood isn\\'t completely without family . \\nit seems he has a half-brother of sorts - not a real brother mind you , just the illegitimate child of his bluesman pseudo-father curtis ( cab calloway from the first film ) , who has also passed on . \\ndespite inklings from mother superior mary stigmata ( kathleen freeman ) to do otherwise , elwood seeks out his only remaining family in an effort to start up an all new blues brothers band . \\nworking as a police commander , cabel chamberlain ( joe morton ) , has an immediate disliking for elwood , who nonchalantly fills cab in on his mother\\'s affair years ago and then goes on to steal his wallet . \\nfollowing elwood around is the lonely orphan buster ( j . \\nevan bonifant ) , who quickly learns to become a mini-elwood . \\nwhen bartender mighty mack mcteer ( john goodman ) joins the group , the blues brothers band is complete , and once again , the group travels the country , crashing cars , blowing things up , and obstructing peace with more than just solid blues rock . \\nmeanwhile , cab\\'s personal vendetta against elwood leads him on an impassioned manhunt for his next-to-next-of-kin . \\n>from this point , the movie turns into a series of music videos with a few bits of acting in between . \\nthose hoping for an interesting and/or funny yarn are given too many musical interludes while those heavily interested in the music are given too much of a story . \\nonly the extremely avid blues fans should attempt getting thru these two hours . \\nfor those people , it may be worth it , for luckily there is much more music than shoddy attempts at acting , but when the story does intrude upon the festivities , the film is heavily bogged down with unfunny jokes , musicians turned stiff actors , and the pointless 10-year- old buster attempting to add some sort of home alone cuteness to the whole thing . \\nappearances by musical legends such as aretha franklin , james brown , eric clapton , and a whole slew of others are the high points of the film , but they also confirm why these people are musicians and not actors . \\nblues brothers 2000 is deserving of one whole star simply because if you really , really love this kind of music , you might kind of , sort of like this movie . \\nmany , many scenes are nauseatingly unfunny , and if you don\\'t have a passion for very deep blues/rock , you\\'ll be bored out of your skull . \\nmuch of this film seems nothing more than aykroyd\\'s self-serving vanity project , but no matter how much fun aykroyd may be having with this , none of the excitement is passed on to the audience . \\nand seeing three guys in three-piece suits goofily dancing around with poker faces can only be funny for so long . \\nunfortunately , those two seconds are over about fifteen minutes into the film . \\n',\n",

       " b'contact is a film that tries to do several different things . \\nit is intended to present a realistic picture of what alien contact might be like , to restore a sense of wonder and mystery to the issue of extraterrestrial life , to raise questions about science and faith and how they would be relevant in such a situation , and to tell a personal story of a romance between the astronomer dr . ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) and the religious spokesman palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) . \\nthe film succeeds wonderfully at its first two goals . \\nthe portrayal of the communication from an alien world is much more reasonable ( albeit less immediately engaging ) than , say , the cold-blooded destructiveness of the invaders in independence day or even the complex process of abductions and genetic hybridization that forms the ongoing plot line of tv\\'s the x-files . \\nthe aliens in contact seem to be like us-they are more curious than anything else . \\nthey know we exist , they want us to know that they exist , and they would like to make the next step and communicate in person . \\nthe film wisely refrains from showing us the aliens directly , and between the characters\\' ongoing speculation about the extraterrestrials and the outstanding visuals in the climactic yet enigmatic scene when arroway arrives on the alien world , that sense of wonder and mystery comes through with a force rarely seen since stanley kubrick\\'s 2001 : a space odyssey . \\nmost of the film , however , takes place on earth , where there is an extended public debate on how to respond to these aliens . \\nscientists are enthusiastic , ultraconservative religious leaders are wary , and government officials are caught somewhere in between . \\nthe debate is fueled largely by dr . arroway\\'s atheism ; she seems the obvious choice to pilot the spacecraft for which the aliens have provided blueprints , but many are wary of sending an atheist as humankind\\'s representative to another species . \\nthe film is partly successful in raising and exploring these questions , especially when it reaches a conclusion that suggests that the two approaches - science and faith - could be viewed as complementary rather than diametrically opposed . \\nstill , the film falls a little short in its representation of this conflict as it exists in american society . \\nthe two \" sides \" are represented primarily by arroway and by far-right fundamentalists , but in reality probably 80% of americans are neither atheists nor far-right fundamentalists . \\npalmer joss occupies something of a middle ground , but he ultimately becomes distracted by personal motives and comes across as a less-than-ideal spokesman for any ideology . \\nthen again , the film does concentrate mostly on public debate , which does , after all , tend to be dominated by extremists , rather than on dinner-table or college-dormitory discussions . \\ncontact is accurate in its portrayal of these issues , then , but only within the narrow scope to which it confines itself . \\nthe film\\'s one clear failure is in the portrayal of the romance between arroway and joss . \\nfor one thing , it resorts to the tired movie clich * that two attractive people will immediately fall in love as soon as they appear on the screen together , as there does not seem to be any other reason for their instant mutual attraction . \\nthe romance rarely , if ever , sheds any light on the characters , although it occasionally tries and fails - joss\\'s explanation that he quit the priesthood because of the celibacy requirement ( \" i guess you could say i\\'m a man of the cloth , but without the cloth \" ) , for example , is more like a punchline to a joke than character development . \\ninstead , the romance mostly seems to exist for the sake of later plot developments . \\ngranted , this is a plot- and idea-driven film and the characters are secondary , but this just seemed like laziness on the writers\\' part more than anything else . \\nthe successes of contact , however , far outweigh its failures . \\neven if the social commentary had fizzled altogether ( which it didn\\'t ) , the simple yet mysterious story of alien communication still would have made it a memorable film . \\ncontact doesn\\'t quite cover all the bases , but it covers about as much as one could hope for in a two-hour film , and its rejection of big-budget theatrics for a more realistic story is certainly admirable . \\nand i would not be surprised if , ten years from now , contact is mentioned in the same breath as 2001 and blade runner as one of the finest examples of sophisticated and intellectually relevant science fiction . \\n',\n",

\\nwho knows . \\nwhat are the implications of this ? \\ni have no idea . \\nmost action films abandon depth in favor of action , and this is normally a problem . \\nknock off , however , is the first film that i would have preferred to see with all of the talky sequences cut . \\nthe acting is embarrassingly bad : rochon , in particular , delivers each of her lines with stiff and talentless insincerity . \\nsorvino , in addition , deserves better than this . \\nvan damme is bad , but he's charming in that bad way , and so i can't say that he's hard to watch ( although i rarely understood what he was saying ) . \\nthe only exception is rob schneider , who is actually quite funny a lot of the time . \\ntsui utilizes so many tricks that he makes john woo look tame by comparison . \\nthey're all pointless gimmicks though , such as shots of the inner-workings of a knock off running shoe . \\nbut his action scenes are never boring : one particular piece inside of a fruit factory ( a fruit factory ?

       " b'with the abundance of trite , recycled movies in the late \\'90s , there is a tremendous demand by movie lovers ( never mind movie critics ) for movies that present the wide film audience with something truly original : perhaps audaciously , perhaps purely thematically . \\nfor the former , you need look no further than director tom tykwer\\'s incredible german thriller run lola run , a movie that may make some viewers need a cooling off period afterwards . \\nlola , a contemporary goth-girl with blazing red hair receives a desperate phone call from her boyfriend manni one day . \\nit seems that because she was late delivering something he lost a bag containing a hundred thousand marks , and if he doesn\\'t deliver a hundred thousand marks within the next twenty minutes , he will be killed . \\nthis gives lola twenty minutes to come up with 100 , 000 marks , or her boyfriend dies . \\nso she runs -- not just jogs , sprints -- in hopes that somehow , someway , she\\'ll be able to obtain the money and save a life . \\n>from there , as critic steve rhodes described it , run lola run plays a bit like \" sliding doors on steroids . \\nwith a non-stop techno soundtrack , wierd camerawork , all kinds of insane zooms and a truly breakneck pace , anyone that is bored with run lola run has to be smoking something . \\nindeed , the movie is often outrageously exciting , as well as bitterly ironic and subtly serious . \\nvery much like titanic , run lola run is an achievement with filmmaking much more than it is an achievement in film . \\nthe way the movie is made , for pure visual style , tykwer\\'s movie is breathtaking ( literally , sometimes ) . \\nthematically it does leave something to be desired ; it toys around with some intriguing ideas but does occasionally seem as if there is little substance behind all of the flash . \\nwhile you are watching , this will not matter . \\nrunning a breezy 81 minutes , this is one movie i wished was longer because it was so damn good while it lasted . \\nit is the equivalent of a roller-coaster in the amount of thrills and fun that it offers . \\n ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ; \\n',\n",
       " b'before even seeing a single frame of the film , it would be easy to snicker at deep impact , in which a comet on a collision course with earth threatens the existence of all life on the planet . \\nit is the latest entry in this decade\\'s dubious revival of the \\'70s disaster film , and the first of two \" the sky is falling \" flicks to hit screens this year ( the other being this coming july\\'s armageddon , in which a meteor is the threat ) . \\nits tagline , \" oceans rise . \\ncities fall . \\nhope survives \" is not as cornball as that of the utterly ridiculous collapsing tunnel thriller daylight ( \" they came in alone . . . the only way out . . . \\nis together \" ) , but it\\'s every bit as treacly . \\nthe opening moments of deep impact offer more to snicker at . \\nthe cheesiness is not confined to the disaster movie conventions , such as the usual opening \" roll call , \" in which all the major characters and their personal problems are introduced . \\nthe most prominent of the \" personal \" stories is that of ambitious tv news reporter jenny lerner ( tea leoni ) , who is distraught that her father ( maximilian schell ) left her mother ( vanessa redgrave ) for a younger woman ( rya kihlstedt ) . \\nwhat is just as snicker-worthy is how this co-venture between paramount and dreamworks skg aggressively pushes another high-profile corporate collaboration , microsoft and nbc\\'s cable news network msnbc , which employs jenny , who is the film\\'s ostensible main character . \\nin the vision of america presented here , msnbc is the television news source of choice in every home , when in reality it only reaches a fraction of the country . \\nthe initial signs point toward something along the lines of a volcano or dante\\'s peak , but there\\'s one thing about deep impact i underestimated : the skills of director mimi leder . \\nshe won an emmy for her helming work on nbc\\'s smash er , which is essentially a weekly disaster movie , each episode featuring a new set of guest stars with their own personal and medical crises . \\nthe challenge presented by this format to the director is twofold : ( 1 ) to make the audience care for these guest characters , regardless of how briefly seen or thinly written they are , and ( 2 ) powerfully tug at the emotions without being heavy-handed or overly melodramatic . \\nhaving passed the \" er challenge \" in numerous episodes and showed a flair for creating suspense in the peacemaker , leder could not be a better fit to bring michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin\\'s rather formulaic disaster screenplay to screen . \\nas the countdown to impact progresses , the ominous feeling of doom is palpable , leading the final act to take on a surprisingly convincing and affecting emotional dimension . \\nthere\\'s nothing here that will profoundly move anyone , but the fact that anything manages to touch the heart is high achievement in a genre generally more concerned with effects . \\nsituations that initially feel contrived , such as jenny\\'s familial crisis and the teenage romance between sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) and comet discoverer leo biederman ( elijah wood ) , achieve some poignance ; and even the more vaguely drawn characters , including u . s . president tom beck ( morgan freeman ) , astronaut spurgeon \" fish \" tanner ( robert duvall ) , and his rather faceless crew ( ron eldard , jon favreau , mary mccormack , blair underwood , and alexander baluyev ) aboard the comet-bombing spacecraft messiah , have their share of touching moments . \\nthe latter fact owes a debt to the actors , who all do a solid job and are well-cast , with the possible exception of leoni ; she delivers a decent performance , but her trademark unconventional speech rhythms and line delivery make her somewhat hard to buy as a star news broadcaster . \\nalthough its catastrophic theme and impressive special effects work ( the giant ocean waves are particularly spectacular ) place deep impact in the same category as the likes of twister , it is the first of the \\'90s disaster films to successfully marry the advanced film technology with emotions that ring true--a film that makes a genuine impact , even if it isn\\'t as deep as hoped . \\n',\n",

       " b'it\\'s time to take cover . \\nafter a hiatus of about fifteen years , the disaster movie has come back with renewed zest . \\nin early 1997 , there were no less than three movies about volcanoes alone , one on television and two in the theaters , with dante\\'s peak and volcano in heavy competition for the moviegoing dollar . \\nof the two , i had heard that dante\\'s peak was the better film , so i decided to check it out when it was released on video . \\nthe film begins with a slow motion scene of people in a third world country trying to evacuate their little town . \\nthe town is being covered in ash and sulfuric water from what we presume is a volcanic eruption . \\nflaming rocks of various sizes also fall from the sky , crushing homes and people . \\nwe see people panicking , people crying , and even horses rearing . \\nit is a disaster of biblical proportions , signified to us by one person dragging a cross down a road . \\nsymbolism doesn\\'t get much more blatant than that . \\nwe learn that harry dalton ( pierce brosnan ) , a volcanologist with the u . s . geological survey , was there with his wife when the eruption occurred . \\nharry survived , but his wife did not . \\na few years later , harry is sent to investigate some unusual seismic activity detected near the small town of dante\\'s peak , washington ( which , we are told , has been voted second most desirable place to live ( under 20 , 000 ) by the readers of money magazine ) . \\nthere harry meets rachel wando , a single mother of two who serves as mayor of dante\\'s peak and proprietor of a small coffee shop . \\nalthough the mayor doesn\\'t seem to be alarmed by the presence of a man sent to determine if the mountain next to their town is going to blow up , a few members of the city council are . \\nthey are afraid that harry\\'s presence is going to scare off an investor who has pledged to put millions of dollars into developing dante\\'s peak . \\nthey would rather have any news of possible stirrings within the neighboring dormant volcano swept under the rug . \\nhowever , when an amorous young couple takes a skinny-dip in the local hot springs , they turn up cooked by lava which bubbles up from a small fissure underneath . \\nthus begins a chain of events leading up to the inevitable eruption . \\nthis film contains a number of cliches . \\nthe amorous couple is one . \\nas soon as they doff their clothes , you know they\\'re going to die . \\nthe town busybody and the abrasive mother-in-law make appearances , as does the death-defying dog . \\ncountless familiar scenarios only serve to make this film very predictable . \\nwatching the movie , i was able to not only anticipate each of the major plot elements , but some of the dialogue as well . \\nunfortunate , since much of the dialog is terrible . \\nfor example , harry\\'s boss , paul ( charles hallahan ) , and a team from the u . s . geological survey join harry to assess the situation . \\npaul basically tells the townsfolk that harry\\'s eruption predictions aren\\'t cause for alarm . \\nthis causes harry to leave in a fit of rage , only to turn up the next day , ready for work . \\nwhen paul asks harry why he stayed , he says with grim determination , \" cause this town\\'s in trouble and i\\'m the best man you\\'ve got . \" \\neven better is when harry is trying to explain the need to jolt the residents into leaving . \\nhe likens the situation to how a frog will jump out if dropped into a pot of boiling water . \\nif the frog is in cold water which is gradually heated up , however , the frog won\\'t move and will allow itself to be cooked . \\n \" is that your recipe for frog soup ? \" \\nasks one of the team members . \\n \" it\\'s my recipe for disaster , \" responds harry . \\ndante\\'s peak has a singular talent for pointing out the obvious . \\nour heroes are in a boat in the middle of a lake which harry realizes the volcanic activity has turned to acid . \\nmayor wando demonstrates her brilliant powers of deduction by proclaiming , in a very grave tone , \" acid eats metal . \" \\nthanks for the tip . \\nwhen we first see the u . s . geological survey building , there\\'s a caption labeling it as such . \\nthis wouldn\\'t have been so bad if it weren\\'t for the fact that the caption is right above a sign on the building which reads , in large letters , \" u . s . geological survey . \" \\ni suppose the caption is for people who can\\'t read signs . \\nalthough harry and mayor wando become an item by the end of the film , the viewer has no idea why . \\nthere is a severe lack of chemistry between the two characters , and the relationship seems rushed because of this . \\nwhen they get close to kissing , i was asking myself , \" why do they want to kiss ? \\nwere they even attracted to each other ? \" \\nif i were the mayor , i would sure think twice about kissing a guy who doesn\\'t even crack a smile through the whole movie , trying to pull off the rough-yet-debonair act . \\nwho does he think he is ? \\njames bond ? \\nthe eruption of the volcano feels similarly rushed . \\nthere are several \" warning signs \" prior to the eruption itself , but they are so lackluster and without suspense that we don\\'t feel as if they are leading up to anything . \\nfor example , one of the survey team members makes his way down into the crater of the volcano in order to retrieve a remote controlled robot . \\na tremor occurs . \\ndoes he plunge headlong to his death ? \\nis he engulfed in lava which shoots up from below ? \\nno , a couple of rocks fall on him and break his leg . \\nthe sole purpose of this scene seemed to be to set up the subsequent chopper rescue scene , which i suppose was intended to be dramatic as well . \\nit wasn\\'t . \\none plot thread left noticeably hanging was the investment in the town of dante\\'s peak . \\nin a disaster movie , there\\'s usually one guy who\\'s greedy enough to cover up the possibility of eruption/fire/earthquake/explosion/tsunami/tornado/meteorite , and usually gets killed by the disaster . \\nit\\'s okay , of course , because we all think he got what he deserved . \\nif you\\'re going to be unoriginal , you might as well go all the way . \\nin dante\\'s peak , the city councilmembers are concerned , but they don\\'t really try hard enough . \\nmaybe the mayor\\'s abrasive mother-in-law should have been the one . \\nfor no apparent reason , she snaps at harry for even positing that the volcano could erupt . \\nperhaps her ancestors invested in some pompeii real estate . \\nthere are a couple of good things about this movie . \\nthe first is the scenery . \\nthere are panoramic shots of forests , lakes and mountains that are absolutely beautiful . \\nthe second is the special effects . \\nthey are the closest i\\'ve ever seen to a real pyroclastic eruption . \\nbut when elements which don\\'t speak are going to be the best parts of your movie , you\\'d probably better rewrite the script . \\n',\n",
       " b'you\\'ve heard all the hype . \\nyou\\'ve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler\\'s list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker . \\nif you\\'ve read any reviews , you\\'ve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy . \\nyou also may have heard that this one\\'s too kiddie-friendly , and doesn\\'t have enough content for adults . \\nbelieve the hype . \\nthe effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala\\'s sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth . \\nbut there\\'s something missing here , and it isn\\'t budget or effects - it\\'s everything money * can\\'t * buy . \\nthe actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters . \\nthe most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence . \\nhe is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out . \\nportman\\'s queen amidala and mcgregor\\'s obi-wan kenobi don\\'t fare nearly so well . \\namidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) . \\nand obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he\\'s nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn\\'s batman . \\nhowever , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job . \\nhe also absolutely nails alec guiness\\' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise . \\nin fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that\\'s one of the problems with this film . \\ni would never call myself a \" star wars \" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i\\'ve always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america . \\nhowever , if you are the one person in america who * hasn\\'t * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn\\'t bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost . \\nfor example , one of the film\\'s main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine . \\nfor those of you not recently steeped in \" star wars \" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader\\'s master in \" return of the jedi \" and \" empire strikes back . \" \\nso , obviously , his appearance in \" phantom menace \" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful . \\na lot of the movie is like that . \\nr2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it\\'s obvious that lucas is banking on the audience\\'s pre-existing fondness for them . . . \\nbecause he doesn\\'t do much to add to it in any way . \\nsame goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn\\'t look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy . \\neven * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from \" empire strikes back \" ) , and alderaan ( leia\\'s home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in \" star wars \" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing . \\nwhat\\'s the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ? \\nthe answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty . \\nthere\\'s no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be . \\nanother problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film . \\ni was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters . \\nand jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast . \\nunlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you\\'ll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive \" teenage mutant ninja turtles . \" \\nfurthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot . \\noddly , this isn\\'t just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids . \\nwell , he\\'s done a good job . \\nthe hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy . \\nthat\\'s not jake lloyd\\'s fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him . \\nthat\\'s another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader . \\nwarning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! ! \\nin my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin\\'s future evil in the film . \\nthe boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there\\'s nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie . \\nhe has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine . \\nbut the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn\\'t all hearts and roses is yoda\\'s hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn . \\nhis explanation ? \\n \" his future is clouded . \" \\n ( warning : major spoiler ahead . \\nenter at your own risk . ) \\nof course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side . \\nthis dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup . \\nbecause qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon\\'s young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself . \\nso , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin \" darth vader \" skywalker . \\ndid this story need to be told ? \\ni would say no . \\nbut is it a worthwhile movie to see ? \\nabsolutely . \\nif you don\\'t enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie . \\nthe tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation . \\nthe digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight . \\nand yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time . \\nabove all , this is a fun movie . \\nnot deep , not meaningful , and not profound . \\nbut fun . \\nmaybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed \" empire \" will direct . \\nbecause if lucas does the next one himself , it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential . \\n : ) \\n',\n",

       " b'catherine deane ( jennifer lopez ) is a psychologist who has been hired to participate in a project where she can enter the minds of comatose victims and try to interact with their subconscious in an attempt to wake them up . \\nshe has been experiencing moderate success with a young boy in a coma , but the boy\\'s parents aren\\'t happy with the apparent lack of progress and the toll of her job is having adverse affects on her regular life . \\nas if trying to assure the boy\\'s parents wasn\\'t hard enough on her , a new development arises that furthers the strain on deane\\'s mental faculties . \\na vicious serial killer named carl stargher ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) has been kidnapping women , locking them in an automated cell that drowns them slowly in a matter of days , then soaking the corpses in bleach to turn them into life-sized dolls . \\njust after kidnapping his latest victim and locking her in the cell , stargher has a traumatic experience that triggers a schizophrenic virus in his brain and causes him to sink in an eternal catatonia . \\nthe police , led by fbi agent peter novak ( vince vaughn ) are able to locate stargher by some clues he left while dumping his previous victim\\'s body , but they feel all hope is lost for his current victim due to his vegetative state . \\nin a last ditch attempt , they ask deane and the scientists that created the project to undergo the frightening task of entering stargher\\'s mind to try and find the location of the victim locked in the deadly cell . . . \\na cell which will completely fill with water in the next 40 hours ! \\ninitial reports about this film described it as a cross between the silence of the lambs and the matrix . \\nwhile it does share some characteristics with both films ( particularly the first forty minutes , which seem almost like a condensed version of lambs ) , the cell also seems to contain elements of dreamscape and brainstorm . \\nthe buzz around this project is that first-time feature film director tarsem singh ( who won many awards for his video of r . e . m . \\'s \" losing my religion \" ) wanted a script that he could fashion images out of instead of a cohesive story , and a good portion of this film supports that theory . \\ndespite the borrowed elements from the aforementioned films and a script that contains several logically questionable moments , the cell does feature some remarkable imagery . \\nall of the sequences where we delve into someone\\'s mind are incredibly beautiful ( including the dank mind of stargher , whose thoughts are reminiscent of an h . r . giger painting come to life mixed with a tool music video ) , proving that singh is as adept at filming strange and wonderful images as his acclaim would lead us to believe . \\nthe first sequence that takes place in stargher\\'s mind is by far the best , featuring one of the most ingenious traps i\\'ve ever seen in a film ( involving a horse , which no one seeing this film will probably forget ) , a zoo-like display of stargher\\'s victims which are animated like marionettes , and stargher himself in a giant purple cape that spans the walls of his mental throne room . \\nif the film had continued within this dirty monstrous world i would have deemed the film brilliant , but alas , the sequences only become more silly as they go along ( despite a painful nipple ring removal later in the film ) . \\nthe cast is basically just an excuse for there to be some moderate plot semblance during the parade of images , but at least vincent d\\'onofrio turns in his usual bizarre and psychotic performance ( magnified by ten , thanks to the environment in which the film has been placed ) . \\nin my opinion , d\\'onofrio was one of the best creepy actors i have ever seen in a film , but his film choices as of late have been so completely awful ( i . e . - \\nthe newton boys , feeling minnesota , the thirteenth floor , and the velocity of gary ) that i have begun to rethink my initial assessment of him . \\nthe character of stargher is an excellent role for him though , and will probably lead to a bit of typecasting for him . \\ndetractors of violence and disturbing images will want to stay far away from this film , as it contains heavy doses of both . \\nbesides the nipple ring removal i mention above , there is also stargher\\'s penchant for hanging suspended off of the floor by the rings that pierce his back and legs ( prior to his catatonia and capture ) which will have audiences recoiling . \\na sequence where catherine enters stargher\\'s mind and finds him recreating the disemboweling of his first victim is also pretty disquieting . \\none moment also features a character having his intestines slowly removed from his body by an old fashioned hand cranked spit-like device . \\nas a narrative film , the cell is sorely lacking . \\nas a collection of images though , the cell is extremely well done . \\nalthough the latter sequences in the film contain fewer disturbing imagery than the first half , singh has done what he supposedly set out to do : make a film solely for the purpose of stringing some remarkable images together . \\nunfortunately , a well-written script should have been considered too , because without it the cell just seems like any other music video we could see on mtv ( provided , of course , that mtv allowed for the use of graphic violence and language in music videos ) . \\n',\n",
       " b'first impressions : critically , a close-to-awful film , but money-wise , it has been doing ( and will continue to do ) great . \\na sometimes-funny film that sags and lags and oftentimes gets boring . \\nan orginal plot that grows old real fast . \\none of the only 90 minute films that i\\'ve gotten bored through . \\nmen in black has defied the odds . \\nwhen i first saw that the flick was 89 minutes long , i thought maybe that this was a poor attempt at an independence day type film that just ran out of gas . \\nhowever , i now realize that not only did men in black run out of gas , but the film in 90 minutes manages to show off a very original idea ( which summer audiences have embraced ) that becomes old about 25 minutes into the movie . \\ntommy lee jones and will smith play two \" government \" agents who are responsible for keeping order in alien society . \\nthe ridiculous plot begins when an alien \" bug \" , played weirdly by vincent d\\'onofrio , who was so great in full metal jacket , lands on earth to retrieve a galaxy that\\'s somewhere on \" orion\\'s belt . \" \\nanyway , the basic plot revolves around jones and smith to stop this bug from getting the galaxy , or a higher power will blow up the earth . \\nthe premise is ridulous , but that is not why i didn\\'t like this film . \\ni love original plots . \\nthis one had an original one . \\nbut director barry sonnenfeld did something to this film that ruined its plot : he made the film drag and also put in unncessary elements in it that are found in romance films . \\nwhenever i saw d\\'onofrio\\'s bug stomp and eat people in the film , it got terribly boring after a while . \\nwhile smith\\'s wise-cracks did fill in the gaps , it wasn\\'t enough . \\nand also , i cannot believe the screenwriters elected to have a sub-plot where tommy lee jones missed his former lover because as an alien agent , they can\\'t have contact with any humans really . \\nand here i see jones , at a satellite computer , watching his lover plant the garden ? \\na sentimental moment in an alien movie ? \\nnice try , but i don\\'t think so . \\nit doesn\\'t work here . \\nit just makes the movie even more ridiculous and even more boring : we don\\'t only have aliens to worry about , but now we have jones\\'s conscience . \\ni came into the movie not wanting to see jones\\'s conscience , but wanting to see a real action movie that had lots of aliens in it . \\nmaybe it\\'s unfair that i partly judged this movie on what my expectations were . \\nnevertheless , even though some parts are indeed funny , the plot in this movie grew old and boring -- quick . \\n',\n",
       " b'why do so many children\\'s films treat their target audience with utter contempt ? \\ntoo many of those who write or direct for children\\'s movies assume that the kids just can\\'t handle serious , thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues . \\n \" the iron giant , \" which was directed and co-written by brad bird , late of such animated series as \" the simpsons \" and \" king of the hill , \" assumes that not only can children handle such discussions , but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time . \\n \" the iron giant \" holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience , making it a film that\\'s enjoyable for both children and adults alike . \\nhogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother , annie ( jennifer aniston ) , in a small town in maine . \\nafter staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away , hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception . \\nhe comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food . \\nafter saving the robot , nicknamed the iron giant , from electric shock , hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts . \\nbecause of damage he suffered upon landing , the giant has forgotten what his original mission was , so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy . \\nrealizing he can\\'t just keep the giant in a barn all the time , and that the giant needs food , he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . ) , an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time . \\nit soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth can\\'t keep the giant a secret forever , because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security . \\nhe suspects hogarth knows something about the giant , and takes up residence in hogarth\\'s house as a lodger . \\nmeanwhile , the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind . \\n \" the iron giant \" is exactly what family films ought to be , because it doesn\\' t talk down to its audience . \\nthe story is simple , very simple , about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy . \\nit\\'s very similar to the spielberg classic \" e . t . , \\' and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of \" the iron giant . \" \\nthe film holds many of the better elements of spielberg\\'s film , such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy . \\nthe film delivers several serious messages , the most important of which is one\\'s ability to choose one\\'s own fate . \\nhogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero . \\nthe final sequence is touching and appropriate , though i won\\'t give it away , i will say that very few will be disappointed . \\nthe animation , while not up to disney standards ( what could be , after \" tarzan \" ? ) , is good enough to make you forget you\\'re watching a cartoon . \\nthe giant is computer-animated , while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way . \\nthe characters\\' faces are done quite well , drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible , but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief . \\nfine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth , and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother . \\nharry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean , and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tv\\'s \" frasier \" ) as an army general called in by agent mansley . \\nunlike several cartoon features , each character is actually a developed personality , rather than a stereotype , and is actually integral to the plot , rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasn\\'t ditched ) . \\ndean , for example , could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that ) , but he is presented as a character with real emotions , thoughts , and motivations . \\neven the heavy , agent mansley , is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to , but out of his own fear and paranoia . \\na lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids won\\'t mind , but \" the iron giant \" has clearly put a little work into making the characters real , and it pays off . \\nthe film isn\\'t only around to deliver heavy-handed messages , though . \\nit\\'s also very funny , and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy . \\nthe scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things , such as dive into a pool , are handled well , and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing , having worked on \" the simpsons \" for many years . \\na sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to \" outlast \" one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed , and also extremely clever . \\nthe film even takes some jabs at america\\'s nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war , satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to \" duck and cover \" in the event of a nuclear attack . \\n \" the iron giant \" has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films , and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing . \\ninstead of seeing people get bonked on the head , we get well-timed , clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with . \\nwhen you get right down to it , \" the iron giant \" is no more than the story of a boy and his robot . \\nthe story is so straightforward , so quaint , that it ultimately becomes charming . \\nthough i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person , when it comes to family entertainment , simple is the way to go . \\nit\\'s akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word , but it\\'s not the story that sets the film above others of its kind , but rather the elements that go into the story , namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue , which \" the iron giant \" has in spades . \\n',\n",

thin and predictable ; the acting is monumentally bad ; and the style of film making resembles a home video . \\nit is december 31 , 1981 and the big party is at monica's ( martha plimpton ) house . \\nbut no one has arrived yet . \\nher 8 invited guests and several people that they have picked throughout the evening are wandering the streets of new york city in various groups . \\nsome of them know each other through their common bond of having slept with monica , and some are total strangers . \\nbut they all are to face their own personal neuroses before night's end . \\nthose who are invited are the ones that have the issues . \\nit is up to those who aren't to help them come to terms . \\nfirst there is eric ( brian mccardie ) who is a former boyfriend of monica's and is just getting over the heartbreak of their relationship terminating prematurely because of his sexual performance , or lack thereof . \\nhe is one of the most bland characters , in a film full of dullness , because he is so utterly predictable and stereotypical , a common trait of this poor production . \\nbridget ( nicole parker ) and caitlyn ( angela featherstone ) who are both extremely sensuous young women looking for someone to handle their desires on new year's eve and tag along to the party with them . \\nthey stumble across a nameless bartender ( ben affleck ) who is the one truly perfect character in a film of imperfections . \\nhe is nether sexually deprived , nor uncertain about his future , as he is in law school . \\nhis lack of flaws is both boring , unrealistic and painful to watch . \\nas bridget and caitlyn make passes at him you are neither entertained nor humored by the sub-standard comedy . \\nmoving on , there is val ( christina ricci ) and stephie , ( gabby hoffman ) 2 teenage girls with fake identification and very different thoughts . \\nval is monica's cousin and a true fan of the new york scene . \\non the other hand , stephie is convinced that she is vulnerable to crime when the two venture out of their usual locations in search of the party that they just can't find . \\nparadoxically , it is 2 punks that they meet at a bar ( actually they attempt to flee from their presence , but aren't successful ) who guide them through their fears and force a level of relaxation upon their warped minds . \\nof all the insanely dull and uninteresting couples , only one approaches a level of decency in both acting and plot . \\nwisely , the movie's creators have put heavy emphasis on lucy ( courtney love ) and kevin ( paul rudd ) who are best friends and share the common bond of being dateless . \\npaul has just broken up with long time steady ellie ( janeane garofalo ) and is starting to come to terms with his loss when lucy informs him that ellie had been sleeping around during their relationship . \\nhowever , the only complexity to these two characters is that they seem to want to be more than friends , and that is reiterated when they attempt sexual intercourse in a bathroom stall on more than one occasion during this strange evening . \\nfinally , there are the two worst performances and worst sub-plot of the film . \\njack ( jay mohr ) and cindy ( kate hudson ) have been going out for a short period of time and jack just learned that he took cindy's virginity the night before . \\nwhile she attempts to play this down and be her usual self , he is a predictably self loathing male as he attempts to deal with a string of one night stands that includes the recently deflowered cindy . \\nvery often , when a film is as putrid as this production , there will at least be a decent quality of film making to reveal an occasional moment of glory . \\nhowever , this film has neither the quality of cinematography nor the moments of glory to be highlighted . \\ninstead , what you get is a collection of rough and inconsistent cuts , bad continuity and inaccuracies . \\nfirst , and most noticeable is that as the film goes from one subplot to another , there is no apparent order that it follows , and it is also weekened by unnecessarily edgy edits from scene to scene and shot to shot . \\nat other times , objects seem to get up and move and hairstyles and costumes change from shot to shot . \\nthere are also at least 4 scenes in a taxi cab that go from start to finish . \\nnot in a single one of them does anybody pay the driver . \\nand yet , no matter how miserable this film may be , and no matter how poor the acting is all around , there was a ray of a hope for these many bad plots . \\nperhaps , if the makers had just decided to concentrate on one or two or , perhaps , even three , there might have been the time and opportunity for some character development , or quality acting , or even a decent plot payoff at the end . \\nbut it didn't happen that way . \\nthe cast of quality name actors was forced into roles that not even one of them could convert into a mediocre performance , and every story line crashed and burned quicker than it takes for the ball to drop at midnight . \\n\",\n",

\\nbulworth\\'s candor wins him three volunteers from the church , one of whom , nikki ( halle barry ) , he gets a crush on . \\nhe feels so good afterwards that he actually eats something . \\nchicken wings , appropriately enough . \\nbulworth shows up late for his meeting with some movie studio executives . \\nwhen one of them asks where he stands on government regulation of movie and tv ratings , bulworth drifts to the topic of the quality of filmed entertainment . \\nwith so much money and so many talented people working so hard , he wonders , why can\\'t hollywood make a quality product . \\n ( you go , warren ! ) \\nwhen they become indignant and ask why he\\'s talking to them if he has such a low opinion of their product , he callously admits that it\\'s because they are rich jews . \\nthat night he drops the three african-american volunteers at their nightclub , and he decides to go in with them . \\nhe stays up all night drinking , smoking pot , dancing , falling in love with nikki , and learning to scratch turntables and rap . \\nthe next day , he shuns his prepared speech and instead raps to the suit-and-tie fundraisers . \\nfrom then on , at all of his political appearances , he raps his political truth . \\nhis rap is not bad for a middle-aged white guy . \\nhe\\'s not very good , but it is his first try and at least he\\'s not embarrassingly bad . \\nhis lobbyists are not amused , but the rest of his constituency seems to like the new bulworth . \\neventually , the movie\\'s plot ( remember he hired a hit man ? ) \\novertakes the politics , which is too bad . \\nscreen time is spent with bulworth trying to cancel the request for his assassination while the hit man seems to be closing in on him . \\nthere are even a few gratuitous chase scenes , bulworth fleeing his killer . \\nthese scenes may have been necessary to keep the events of the film moving along , but it distracted and detracted from bulworth\\'s political ranting , which was much more interesting than the ever-present , obvious-looking assassin . \\nstill , most of the movie is original and very enjoyable , and beatty deserves most of credit for bringing it to the screen . \\nas the story and screen writer , he came up first with a good structure , then with good dialogue to back it up ( jeremy pikser co-wrote the screenplay ) . \\nas an actor , he was able to convincingly portray bulworth\\'s depression , then liberation and rebirth . \\nas a producer ( there were four others ) he was able to keep the movie free from hollywood\\'s indulgent formulas ( except for those inexcusable chase scenes ) . \\nsomeone else probably could have directed , but since he was there anyway , what the heck . \\nit\\'s too bad that there aren\\'t more movies like this around - movies that tackle political corruption in a way that challenges viewers to pay more attention to real politics . \\nafter all , much of the inspiration for bulworth is straight out of the news . \\njust a little perception and insight and you could write your own bulworth rants . \\njust don\\'t expect to be popular with the insurance companies . \\n',\n",

       " b'true faith and its expression through organized religion is a difficult subject for a motion picture to tackle head-on , which is probably why so few of them do it . \\neven the most religious directors - like martin scorsese or ingmar bergman - usually address issues of faith in implicit rather than explicit religious terms . \\nso it\\'s not hard to see why it took robert duvall fifteen years to get \" the apostle \" onto the big-screen . \\nas a matter of fact , even after fifteen years he still never managed to get financial backing , and he ended up paying for it with $5 million of his own money . \\nhe also wrote the script , directed the film , and starred as the central character , a fiery texas preacher named euliss \" sonny \" dewey . \\nfew filmmakers have the courage and sheer audacity to take on that kind of financial , technical , and creative responsibility single-handedly , and it\\'s testament to what an intensely personal project this was for duvall . \\nand , thankfully , every bit of that personal investment translates on-screen into power and honest emotion . \\nsonny is an energetic , pentecostal preacher who has been speaking ( actually shouting ) from behind the pulpit since he was twelve . \\nhe spends much of his time traveling about the country , evangelizing with other preachers at tent revivals . \\nunlike most hollywood characterizations of intense preachers , sonny is not a phony or a swindler , and the film\\'s purpose is not to unearth hypocrisy and sin in either sonny or the church . \\nduvall makes it abundantly clear that sonny truly believes in what he says , although like all humans , he has weaknesses . \\none of his weaknesses become apparent when he finds out that , not only does his long-suffering wife , jessie ( farrah fawcett ) , want to leave him for another man in the congregation , but the two of them have secretly plotted to remove him as preacher . \\nfaced with the loss of two things he loves passionately- his church and his family - that same raw power that allows sonny to get entire congregations rocking and swaying transforms into a violent temper . \\nat his son\\'s baseball game , sonny snaps and smashes his wife\\'s lover in the face with a baseball bat , inflicting a wound that may be fatal . \\nnot knowing what else to do , sonny disappears . \\nhe throws away his identification , drives his car into a lake , and takes a bus to louisiana , hoping to start over again . \\nin the tiny , mostly poor coastal town of bayou boutte , sonny once again finds his calling . \\nafter befriending a simple auto mechanic ( walt goggins ) and tracking down the town\\'s ex-minister ( john beasley ) , sonny sets up his own church , the one way to heaven temple . \\nre-christening himself as \" the apostle e . f . , \" he quickly draws together an eager congregation , and together they realize real change in each other\\'s lives . \\nbut , always , sonny\\'s past is lurking a step behind him , waiting to swallow his progress . \\nduvall has made his intentions in making \" the apostle \" clear . \\nin a recent article in \" newsweek , \" he wrote : \" filmmakers hardly ever depict spirituality with such a strong emphasis on the holy spirit , and when they do , it tends to be patronizing - full of charlatans and snake handlers . . . \\nbut what i really wanted to do was try to understand what these preachers go through and what they believe , and to portray it in an accurate way . \" \\nthe strength of duvall\\'s convictions turn out to be the strength of his film - \" the apostle \" always rings true , even in the most painful moments , because we know he\\'s being sincere with the subject matter . \\nafter fifteen years of traveling the country , listening to all shapes and sizes of ministers and taking studious notes on what they said , duvall has captured the energy and vitality of what it means to be truly spiritual . \\nhis sonny is a man who speaks directly to god and expects to be spoken right back to . \\n \" i\\'ve always called you jesus and you\\'ve always called me sonny , \" he says . \\nwhen neighbors call and complain that he is being too loud one night in one his rants with the man upstairs , sonny\\'s mother ( june carter cash ) just hangs up on them because she knows there\\'s no sense trying to interrupt him . \\nthe main theme to emerge from \" the apostle \" is the fact that good can come from any situation . \\nsonny\\'s act of violence toward another human being is inarguably a horrific thing , and duvall never shrinks from that fact . \\nhowever , that very same act of violence is what brings sonny to bayou boutte , where he finds people whom he desperately needs and who desperately need him . \\nin his short time in louisiana , he does a world of good , and when the police finally show up to take him away , he goes quietly , knowing that he deserves the punishment that is awaiting him . \\nand , as a scene during the final credits shows , he even turns his punishment into a positive opportunity for change and betterment . \\nit is that strength in sonny\\'s character that makes him so appealing and magnetic to others - he is flawed , but he is powerful enough to overcome those flaws . \\nweak men are the ones who simply accept their weaknesses and lack the desire to better themselves . \\nwatching duvall on-screen , it\\'s not hard to imagine that he would have been a magnificent preacher if he had chosen that vocation over acting . \\nas sonny , he completely inhabits the character , and his performance is certainly the best of the year . \\nbecause he spent so much time absorbing the traits , methods , quirks , and personalities of real preachers , duvall was able to create a complete character who always feels indelibly human . \\nas a director , duvall feels that less is more . \\nhis camera simply takes in what goes on in front of it , with very little intrusion . \\nthere are no fancy crane shots or extended dollies or excessive close-ups . \\nduvall knew that the power of the film\\'s characters ( enhanced by the fact that he cast mostly non-professional churchgoers and actual ministers ) didn\\'t need to be artificially enhanced . \\nin this way , \" the apostle \" almost plays out like a documentary , not only in its technical simplicity , but more importantly , in its sense of reality . \\n',\n",

       " b'more than forty years ago , the \" sword and sandals \" genre of historical epic ruled the box office . \\nduring the 1950\\'s hollywood sought to give audiences a reason to turn off their televisions and go out to the movies by offering the grand spectacle of the roman empire in cinemascope . \\n \" ben-hur . \" \\n \" cleopatra . \" \\n \" the robe . \" \\n \" sparticus . \" \\n \" the fall of the roman empire . \" \\n \" quo vadis . \" \\nsometimes brilliant , sometimes campy , the roman epic was the technicolor funeral pyre of classic hollywood . \\nsince then , epics have appeared infrequently ( \" the last emperor , \" \" braveheart \" ) and some of the best have been small-screen affairs produced in the 1970\\'s ( \" roots , \" \" shogun \" ) . \\nyet , the phrase \" we who are about to die salute you \" has been absent until now . \\n \" gladiator \" begins in germania in a . d . 180 . \\nroman general maximus ( russell crowe ) has conquered yet another group of barbarians for his emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) , and he is eager to retire to his plantation in spain where his wife and son are waiting . \\nhowever , the emperor is worried that his decadent weakling son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) will prove a poor successor , so he wants to make maximus his heir as a transition toward rome becoming a republic again . \\nwhen commodus hears the plan , he strangles his father and orders maximus and his family murdered . \\nmaximus escapes from the executioners , but he arrives home too late to save his wife and son . \\na caravan of slavers pick up the wounded hero and carry him off to north africa . \\n ( why the caravan happened to be cruising by maximus\\' place is never explained . ) \\nan african named juba ( djimon hounsou ) treats maximus\\' wounds . \\nproximo ( oliver reed ) , a gladiator who won his freedom , purchases maximus and juba as fodder for the arena . \\nof course , maximus proves as able a gladiator as he was a soldier , and his fame spreads . \\nwhen commodus reopens the coliseum , proximo brings his troupe of warriors to rome to compete . \\nour hero wins the hearts and minds of the cheering crowds and finds that he has an ally in commodus\\' sister lucilla ( connie nielsen ) . \\nthe similarities to \" braveheart \" are obvious : an evil king , a determined warrior seeking revenge for his murdered family , the aid of a lovestruck princess . \\nalso , like mel gibson\\'s epic , \" gladiator \" has a primarily visceral appeal and is driven forward by the hero\\'s anger . \\nit\\'s a simple tale of good versus evil . \\nmaximus has all the manly virtues : nobility of purpose , courage in battle , loyalty to king and country , physical stamina , and devotion to family . \\ncommodus is his opposite in every way : a sniveling , selfish coward who is intended to disgust the audience . \\nthe opening night crowd in my theater was about 70% male , and that seems appropriate . \\n \" gladiator \" is a guy movie ( would the opposite of a \" chick flick \" be a \" dick flick \" ? ) . \\nthere\\'s much pumping of testosterone and chopping off of body parts in gruesome battle sequences . \\n ( those easily offended by gore should stay away . ) \\nlucilla is the only female character , and what sparks there are between her and maximus are dampened by his devotion to his dead wife . \\njoaquin phoenix gives an astounding performance . \\nin the scene where commodus kills his father , phoenix shows the pain of a son who has never had his father\\'s love or pride . \\nthroughout the picture , phoenix manages to give depth to a character who\\'s scripted as a caricature of evil . \\ni\\'ve been a russell crowe fan since \" romper stomper . \" \\nthis role doesn\\'t offer him the complexities of his parts in \" l . \\na . confidential \" and \" the insider \" -- essentially his job is to grunt heroically -- but his voice , which has a richard burton resonance textured by a clint eastwood rasp , is perfect for the genre . \\nthe late oliver reed gave us the best work of his career in his last role . \\ni hope it will be rewarded with an oscar . \\nmy only major quibble with \" gladiator \" is its stylized look . \\nseveral scenes are tinted . \\nwe\\'ve seen a lot of the tinted look lately , particularly in \" payback \" and \" the matrix . \" \\ni don\\'t get the appeal of the style , which makes feature films look like tv ads . \\nin \" payback \" it was merely annoying , but in \" gladiator \" it bleaches the color out of the grand spectacles that are the raison d\\'etre of the roman epic . \\n ( perhaps it\\'s meant to gloss over the imperfections of the computer-generated shots . ) \\nalso , the battle scenes are filmed in a strange herky jerky style that seems to be slo mo and fast forward simultaneously . \\n ( it reminds me of the way the flash runs in the comic books , leaving a half-blurred trail of images of himself behind . ) \\nwith a more realistic look , \" gladiator \" could be even more satisfying than \" braveheart \" because it has a tighter script and a more fulfilling conclusion . \\nbottom line : a rousing action film enriched by fine performances but tarnished by stylistic choices . \\n',\n",

       " b'it\\'s a shame the execution of this concept falls very short of its premise . \\nthe movie is lacking and most unsatisfying . \\nosmosis jones is crude , gross , disgusting , and was directed by the farrelly brothers - the twisted siblings behind there\\'s something about mary , me , myself and irene and a couple of other movies in which the humor is mostly targeted below the belt . \\nnot that there\\'s anything wrong with scatology . \\ni bet even cavemen appreciated bathroom humor - such as it was . \\nit\\'s merely that with osmosis jones , the farrellys humor is too juvenile , too predictable . \\nyou can almost foresee the puns just by viewing the part of the inner anatomy a sequence is drawn . \\nosmosis jones looks like one of those old health class movies gone psycho . \\nthe trouble is , the animation may please the very young , but the jokes may be over their heads , while the teen-age audience may find it too tame for their tastes . \\nadults ? well , let\\'s just say most will find it unappetizing . \\nosmosis jones plays like a 100-minute infomercial for the eat healthy foods lobby . \\nthe live action sequences revolve around frank ( bill murray ) , who seems to be the grungiest human being in the universe . \\nhe continually looks as if he needs a shave and a shower . \\nfrank , much to the consternation of his daughter , is a fast-food addict , eating anything - and everything - that can kill you . \\nhe works at a zoo where the animals look cleaner - and presumably smell better - than he does . \\nfrank\\'s body is invaded by thrax , a lethal virus , after frank eats a hard-boiled egg that had fallen to the ground . \\nit\\'s not gross enough that frank picks the egg up from the dirt and plops it into his mouth . \\nnope , the farrellys pile it on by first having frank wrestle a chimp for the egg , wresting it from the primate\\'s mouth . \\nlike i said , the gross meter tips the scales on this one . \\nafter ingesting the egg , the movie begins its animated sequences . \\nhere , osmosis jones ( voiced by chris rock ) , a renegade white blood cell is teamed with drix ( voiced by frasier\\'s david hyde pierce ) , a 12-hour , painkiller cold capsule to battle thrax ( smoothly voiced by laurence fishburne ) . \\nbasically , what we have is a cliched cop-buddy movie , rife with all the clich ? s of that genre . \\nand this is why osmosis jones doesn\\'t click . \\nit merely falls back on tired , familiar conventions instead of creating new and exciting situations . \\nthe jokes and puns are lame : osmosis searches out a snitch , a former flu virus . \\nafter pumping him for information , drix tells osmosis , \" funny , he doesn\\'t look fluish . \" \\nand the jokes don\\'t rise above that level . \\nthe live action scenes are no better . \\nfrank is such a slob , so unappealing that it is difficult to fathom how he ever married or even sired a child . \\nhe\\'s almost a bigger cartoon than the animated characters . \\nosmosis jones is a movie that may be too violent for young children as thrax burns and dissolves blood cells right and left . \\nthe animation is rather two-dimensional and flat . \\nit lacks scope and depth . \\nit is an unappealing movie that will leave you scratching your head , and maybe leaning toward a shower after you walk out of the theater . \\n',\n",
       " b'seen september 13 , 1998 at 4 p . m at rotterdam square mall cinema 6 , theater #2 , with chris wessell for free using my sony/loews critic\\'s pass . \\n[theater rating : * * 1/2 : good seats , average sound , picture unstable] \\n \" rounders \" is exactly the kind of movie parents don\\'t want their kids to see . \\nit\\'s not that it\\'s a drunken orgy of sex and violence , but because it\\'s a film that flat-out says you can make a career out of gambling . \\nand to take make things \" worse \" it proves this through its original , fascinating story . \\nthere have been countless crime films both past and present that evoke the \" noir \" mood , that is , the dark , shady atmosphere where the vices of the world become more fascinating on screen than they would in real life . \\nthis film starts off in the tradiational noir style , introducing us to the underworld of modern gambling where the stakes are high and so is the price for losing . \\nmatt damon stars as mike mcdermott , a 20-something law student in present-day new york city who tells us how the game of poker is really played . \\ndamon narrates throughout the film , but the entire opening scene is voiced-over so perfectly to completely and totally define the setting . \\nmike\\'s about to go up against teddy kgb ( malkovich ) , a russian gangster who looks like a serial killer . \\nbut then again , he practically is one and the film does everything to convey that sense - the look in his eyes , his slow movements , his intricate mannerisms - all combined with the classic noir cinematography of isolated brightness within the darkness of the underworld ( literally ) . \\ndamon in the flesh might seem a little out of place with his expensive clothes and perfectly-groomed features , but his narration is what brings it all together . \\nhe never sounds like he\\'s reading from a script , nor that he\\'s trying to embellish anything , it just comes natural to him . \\nthe screenwriters use the right words and phrases to describe the mood , from the smell of the air , to the logic involved in reading the other guys\\' faces and cards , and all without sounding remotely trite . \\nimmediately we get the sense that poker isn\\'t for gamblers , but for near- geniuses with nerves of steel . \\nthe game is a quiet war , with strategies just as complex and the same sense of honor among the soldiers . \\nthe gangsters mike plays against are the same ones that might kill someone for scratching their car , but when it comes to the game of poker , all respect is due to the winner because he is truly the better man . \\nthe film does an excellent job in establishing its atmosphere during the first act . \\nit concentrates so much in this aspect that the background and the progression of the story stumble a bit . \\nwe learn only a little about mike , both past and present . \\npresently we know he has a girlfriend named jo ( gretchen mol ) who he constantly argues with over his gambling . \\nthey go through a few break-up/make-up cycles until mike\\'s childhood pal and fellow rounder \" worm \" ( norton ) is released from prison . \\nit\\'s not at all surprising worm owes thousand of dollars to the mob , but what is surprising is how the film is able to take such a predictable element and execute it the way it does . \\ntechnically , the plot isn\\'t unlike many children\\'s sitcoms in which the \" good \" kid\\'s \" bad \" friend gets the good kid in trouble and yet the good kid remains friends with the bad kid . \\nwhat this film does is use a different medium to tell that story . \\nmike and worm have been in over their heads their entire lives , but both share a passion for out-thinking the other player who is trying to do the same to them . \\nwhere as worm prefers to go the sleazy route of cheating ( hence his jail time ) , mike always takes the cards he\\'s dealt and works with them . \\nsometimes they pay off ( i . e . \\nhis ability to pay his way through law school on his gambling money ) , but other times they don\\'t ( i . e . \\nthe fact he takes himself out of the game and works a steady job after dropping $30 , 000 on a single hand ) . \\nonce things start happening the film is able to expand and develop its plot into an intricate web of detail and mood . \\nmike and worm bob and weave through all kinds of games at all kinds of places , from socialites\\' mansions , to taking the tourists at atlantic city , to outwitting the gangsters that control it all . \\neverything they come into contact with is a big poker game in that everything\\'s a battle against the cards destiny deals . \\none scene demonstrates this perfectly in which mike is told by a judge ( martin landou , in a perfectly cast and performed role ) that destiny is everything and yet nothing at the same time . \\nmatt\\'s good at gambling but he\\'s also got potential to be a great lawyer . \\nhe could go professional as either , but with one he could lose everything or win big , but with the other there\\'s stability but not much risk involved . \\ncan someone who\\'s gambled his entire life really cash in his chips and leave ? \\nif the film had been just a subtle lesson in poker-playing , then the ending is our test . \\neverything is told from mike\\'s perspective , but we\\'re finally able to recognize some things on our own . \\nthis makes the final , against-all- odds showdown seem like just that . \\nit works just like the game it revolves around - showing us some of the cards , but still evokes the element of the unknown , and the consequences thereof . \\nwhat separates \" rounders \" from most other films about games is the fact the challenge and the skills are more important than winning in the end . \\n',\n",
       " b'renowned hong kong action director tsui hark first teamed with jean-claude van damme on the action star\\'s 1997 pairing with dennis rodman , _double_team_ , and managed to make what initially appeared to be a disaster into a slick , stylish , and somewhat diverting action timekiller . \\ntsui continues to energetically pile on the visual razzle dazzle in his latest collaboration with the muscles from brussels , _knock_off_ , but this time around , style neither save a script that is at best ridiculous , and at worst incomprehensible ; nor hide a host of truly lousy performances . \\nwriter steven e . desouza\\'s fairly straightforward plotline isn\\'t as outre as _double_team_\\'s strange yarn involving a secret think tank/prison , but it makes about as much sense , which is little . \\nvan damme plays marcus ray , a hong kong-based sales rep for a jeans company ( ! ) who stumbles upon a russian terrorist scheme to implant powerful microchip-sized bombs in hk product exports to the u . s . --dolls , electronic equipment , and , yes , jeans . \\nit\\'s all part of some type of ransom scheme , but all i remember is--and i kid you not--graphics on a cia computer screen showing a map of the world , bombs detonating , and an hat-wearing figure on the other side of the world bursting out into laughter . . . \\n . . . which is what the crowd at the showing i attended spontaneously did throughout _knock_off_ . \\nwhile all of van damme\\'s films have its share of unintentional laughs , mostly due to the stiff acting \" skills \" of the physically agile van damme , _knock_off_ delivers more than usual ( though not as many as van damme\\'s embarrassing directorial effort , 1996\\'s _the_quest_ ) . \\na lot of the laughs are earned by some particularly painful lines by desouza : \" i smoked that badass like a roman candle ! \" \\nand \" entrepreneurship , babycakes ! \" \\nstanding out among my favorites . \\nbut it is indeed the pathetic performances that provide the bulk of _knock_off_\\'s laughs . \\nvan damme is true to laughable form , perhaps even worse than usual . \\nearly scenes actually _require_ him to make funny with co-star rob schneider ( improbably cast as a deep cover cia agent posing as marcus\\'s business partner ) , and the sight and sound of the still-heavily-accented van damme haplessly trying to drop punchlines is hilarious in the wrong way . \\neven typically good actors are not immune to the bad acting bug . \\npaul sorvino is unconvincing and terribly overwrought as schneider\\'s cia superior ; and lela rochon , playing an investigator for the jeans company , spends the entire movie in perpetual snarl mode . \\nin rochon\\'s defense , though , her role requires her to do little more than display her toned legs , exquisite bone structure , and perky bosoms , the latter coming in handy for one key scene where she must fish for microbombs stuck in her ample cleavage . \\ntsui picks up where he left off visually in _double_team_ , juicing up the proceedings with inventive camera work . \\nhere , though , tsui\\'s visual razzle dazzle borders on over kill , coming off as desperate attempts to shield the inanity of the entire enterprise . \\nfor each nifty trick tsui pulls off , such as a recurring visual theme that has the camera literally going through the circuitry of electronic devices , there are others that are completely superfluous . \\nthis is especially disconcerting when the trick in question could be clever when used in the right context . \\nfor instance , one scene early on has marcus putting his hand in a box . \\nas he puts his hand in , the same action is shown from an overhead camera angle in a rectangle at the corner of the screen . \\nit\\'s undoubtedly an interesting visual , but it would have been nice if its use actually amounted to something . \\nthe test of a van damme movie boils down to the action sequences , but surprisingly , those in _knock_off_ leave much to be desired . \\ntsui does what he can to make something of them , employing freeze frames , blurred motion , and unconventional camera angles , but there is nothing fundamentally special about the fairly generic chase and fight sequences written by desouza . \\nthere isn\\'t anything as preposterously amusing as the climactic tiger/land mine fight in _double_team_ , let alone anything remotely close to tsui\\'s legendary hong kong works ( but that\\'s a given going in ) . \\nif tsui has any hope of approaching his countryman john woo\\'s stateside success , he would do best to break free from van damme . . . \\nbefore it\\'s too late . \\nif he continues his involvement with b-grade movies such as _knock_off_ , the respect he has from hk action fans will continue to diminish . . . \\nthat is , if it hasn\\'t already disappeared entirely after this fiasco . \\n',\n",
       " b'the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it\\'s adequately explained by the commercials . \\nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \\ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a \" pageant \" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \\nand if there wasn\\'t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \\n ( a heist comedy ? \\nyup . \\ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \\nwag the dog succeeds because it\\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \\nok , maybe it\\'s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \\n ( any average person who thinks that they\\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \\nand because we\\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \\nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \\nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \\ninstead , david mamet\\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \\nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \\ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \\nit\\'s all : \" what do i love ? \\nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \\nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \\nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \\nit\\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \\nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \\nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\\'s so excited that he can\\'t even shut up . \\neven on the edge of disaster , he\\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \\ninsiders note that he\\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \\nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \\nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\\'t . \\nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \\ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \\nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\\'d go see it . \\nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \\nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \\ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \\n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \\nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \\nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \\nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\\'t . \\n',\n",

       " b'i remember hearing about this film when it first appeared at cannes over a year ago , picking up the grand jury prize at the festival . \\n\\'holocaust comedy receives standing ovation\\' , the headlines read . \\nintrigued by this statement , i looked up information on the film and found that , sure enough , life is beautiful is in fact a comedy about the greatest atrocity of the last thousand years . \\neven though the movie was extremely well-received by critics and public alike , i couldn\\'t help but be disgusted at this notion ; human tragedy is not something i feel should be celebrated . \\nonly now do i see the error of my ways . \\nafter finally viewing the film for myself after avoiding it for some time , it became clear that it is not , as the headlines proclaimed , a \" holocaust comedy \" ; on the contrary , life is beautiful does not even really depict the graphic events that took place in nazi deathcamps . \\nrather , it focuses on the relationship between a father and his son , who he is trying desperately to shield from the horrors of their situation . \\nroberto benigni ( who also wrote and directed the movie ) stars as guido orefice , a chaplin-inspired clown and all round jolly guy who , as the film opens , is vying for the affections of an attractive school teacher ( nicoletta braschi , benigni real life spouse ) . \\nthrough the course of the first hour or so , we see guido striving to get the attention of this \" beautiful princess \" , as he calls her . \\nemploying the magic of laughter , the italian comedian wins her heart and together , they raise a young boy named giosue ( child actor giorgio cantarini ) . \\nlife treats them well until hitler\\'s minions rise to power , and the family is whisked away to a german camp , where guido becomes convinced that he must upholds his son\\'s innocence no matter what the sacrifice . \\ngranted , it contains some uproariously funny moments both in and out of the concentration camp , but it does not pull a \" hogan\\'s heros \" and make light of the slaughtering of some six million innocent jews . \\nsomehow , it achieves hilarity without disrespecting it\\'s gravely serious subject . \\nso , we\\'ve established that life is beautiful is not a \" holocaust comedy \" . \\nbut , there is another complete misrepresentation of this material that really disturbs me . \\nthe film , despite critic\\'s declarations of it being a \" triumph of the human spirit \" , is no such thing ; not in my eyes , anyway . \\nsome have called the story an \" affirmation of the beauty of life \" , but i say it is a very dark and bleak statement about man\\'s capability of denial masquerading as an endearing comedy . \\nthe film\\'s ending has been recognized as the most entirely uplifting moment of any film released recently , but i found it to be truly discerning and upsetting . \\nessentially , life is beautiful is quite possibly the greatest hoax in the history of film . \\nhowever , i am not denying the movie\\'s greatness . \\nbelieve me , it\\'s fantastic . \\ni\\'m just saying that i think benigni did something different than what most people are interpreting it as . \\nbut perhaps i\\'m reading more into the movie than is really there . \\nmaybe the film\\'s brilliance relies on the idea that the viewer can interpret the meaning of it in any way they see fit . \\nin fact , maybe roberto benigni has made a film that is the sole argument for the old saying that you get out of a movie exactly what you put into it . \\n',\n",

       " b'set in the late 80\\'s at the height of yuppie excess and based on the book by bret easton ellis ( who explored the same themes in another book which was also made into a movie , less than zero ) , american psycho puts a new spin on the yuppie \" genre \" that ellis helped to create . \\nchristian bale is perfectly cast as patrick bateman , a high powered yuppie who hides a terrible secret from his fianc ? e and his colleagues . \\nit seems that bateman is a serial killer and , unfortunately for his contemporaries , his tenuous grasp on reality is starting to slip . \\nas he tries to balance his meticulous daily routines with slaughtering co-workers and prostitutes and hiding their bodies , his mental fabric slowly begins to unravel . \\ni was first introduced to the novel when i was still in high school . \\ni read an associated press article in our local sunday newspaper detailing the problems ellis was having getting his novel published due to the controversial violence in it . \\nas usual when anything is controversial i try to seek it out , but i soon forgot about the novel and didn\\'t end up thinking about it again until i stumbled across it a couple of years later at a bookstore . \\ni picked it up and read it , but was ultimately disappointed because it left more questions than answers . \\nthe movie has a similar effect , but at least it\\'s less cryptic than ellis\\' novel . \\nfor once , a film has actually turned out to be better than the novel it was based on . \\nboth the book and the film open with bateman describing his fastidious morning preparations ( down to exactly what facial scrubs and exfoliating creams he uses ) but the novel seems to concentrate more on these excesses throughout . \\nthe movie continues to touch upon these things but makes more of a point to immerse us in bateman\\'s impending madness than to detail things as painstakingly as the novel does . \\nas a result , the film is immensely more entertaining . \\nlions gate seems to be the studio champion of controversial films ( having picked up kevin smith\\'s catholic-rattling dogma ) and here with american psycho there is no difference . \\nscreenwriters mary harron and guinevere turner had the unenviable task of trying to take a novel about yuppies filled with graphic violence and sex and make a marketable film out of it . \\nsome cuts had to be made to the finished film to keep from getting an nc-17 , mainly involving a sex scene comprising bateman and two women , and initial reports said the film was unwatchable . \\nthankfully , it is watchable and harron and turner have made one of the most scathingly satirical films this side of south park : bigger , longer & uncut . \\nside note #1 : co-writer guinevere turner also makes an appearance in the film as an ill-fated acquaintance of bateman\\'s who , after bateman suggests that she start making out with a female prostitute , proclaims that she\\'s not a lesbian nor has any interest in it . \\nthe ironic humor of the scene stems from the fact that turner ( the writer/director of the film go fish and who also assisted kevin smith with parts of his script for chasing amy ) is a lesbian . \\nit\\'s a subtle in-joke and it\\'s one i found to be pretty humorous . \\ndespite having a rather high profile supporting cast of young up-and-comers ( including reese witherspoon ) , most of the roles are a waste and are the equivalent of extended billed cameos . \\nthe real draw here is christian bale and his over-the-top performance as patrick bateman . \\nwhenever i read a novel i always try to imagine what it would be like as a movie and who would be perfect to cast as the characters . \\ni always had a hard time trying to decide who i would cast as bateman , but i never thought bale would deliver a performance as perfect as his ends up being . \\nto say bale runs away with the character is a vast understatement and he proves that he\\'s as adept at chewing scenery as al pacino or rod steiger . \\none sequence in particular , involving bateman describing his love for huey lewis and the news\\' song \" hip to be square \" right before burying an axe in a co-worker\\'s head , features one of the most eccentric and kinetic performances i have ever seen on film . \\nside note #2 : despite the fact that huey lewis\\' \" hip to be square \" and a pair of phil collins songs appear in the film , don\\'t expect to see them on the soundtrack release . \\nhuey lewis expressly requested that his song , featured in a rather large set piece in the film ( much akin to the use of \" stuck in the middle with you \" in reservoir dogs ) , not be included on any soundtrack release . \\ni\\'m assuming that collins requested the same . \\non a similar note , whitney houston\\'s cover of \" the greatest love of all \" is also involved in a scene comparable to the other two and it is very obvious that it isn\\'t the houston version at all but merely an instrumental version culled from an unknown source . \\napparently , houston wasn\\'t as open about the use of her song as the others were . \\na bigger controversy than the violence and sex has been brewing since the film\\'s release : that of whether or not patrick has actually committed the crimes we have viewed during the course of the film . \\ndon\\'t look to the book for any answers because it will only serve to confuse you more . \\nseveral web sites have been dedicated to the subject but i\\'m still undecided . \\nthere is evidence both for and against but the most scathing evidence against comes from a scene near the end of the film where bateman goes on a killing spree taking out cops , old ladies , and cleaning staff with equal gusto . \\nthe scene seemed very dream-like and as absurd as the action films it suddenly seems to be parodying ( as an example , bateman blows up a police car very cinematically after firing several shots from a handgun in the general direction of the car ) . \\ni kept waiting for bateman to wake up and for the film to continue on from there , but bateman never does wake up and the whole sequence , though comic , throws the film off-balance ( which i suppose was the intention ) . \\nother than the few flaws i have mentioned , american psycho is an incredibly entertaining film ( although you may not leave the movie fully understanding whether or not what has just transpired actually occurred in bateman\\'s reality ) . \\ni think this movie is destined for greatness as a cult film and deserves the spot it will take as such . \\nit may not change anyone\\'s life , but it will certainly have an effect . \\ni know i will certainly hear \" hip to be square \" in a different context the next time i hear it . \\n[r]

       " b'i had an epiphany today . \\nit occurred to me while i was watching \" house on haunted hill . \" \\nit is as follows : if a trailer makes the film it\\'s advertising look like a trashy , stupid movie , well guess what ? \\nchances are , there * is * truth in advertising . \\ntoo bad i didn\\'t trust my own instincts when something-or-the-other possessed me to see this movie . \\ni blame it on my sudden craving for a scare and my anticipation of \" sleepy hollow . \" \\nthat and \" dogma \" started too late in the afternoon for my schedule . \\nan hour of \" angel \" or \" buffy \" is scarier than this doozy that tries to be scary and shtick but falls flat on its face . \\ni wish i\\'d seen it when it was halloween . \\nat least i would have been forgiving . \\nhey , tis the season . \\nthe movie was scary ( albeit very confusing , dizzying , and nauseating ) at first , but soon the horror got repetitive and downright laughable because the film obviously wasn\\'t going anywhere . \\nnow i truly appreciate films like \" scream , \" \" halloween , \" or any old hitchcock film where the scariness stems from situations that are at least somewhat realistic . \\nthat\\'s what spooks people out , the fact that it could happen to them or someone they know . \\nthere has to be a logical precedent for the situations they want to scare us with . \\nsure , utterly unpredictable is good , too , but that\\'s different from utterly nonsensical . \\nhohh ( house on haunted hill ) , on the other hand . \\n . \\n . \\nwell let\\'s just say i about fell off my chair laughing when they oh-so-cleverly revealed that everyone who got invited to the party was related to the psycho doctors who died in the house a couple of decades ago . \\nriiiiight . \\ny\\'know , that just sends chills down my spine . \\nyeah . \\njust like i wet my pants when they told me the house is evil . \\nooooooo . \\nhint : blood and guts only work a few times . \\nsooner or later people start to tell themselves that it\\'s just ketchup and props and you\\'ve got to come up with something better than that . \\nthere were just too many things in this movie that we\\'ve all seen before ; from the inevitable \" plot developments \" of strangers unwittingly trapped together ; strangers turning against each other ; the evil manifesting itself ; the dead coming back for a last scare . \\neach was more predictable than the last . \\nwhy didn\\'t these fools just stay together in one place anyways ? \\nsheesh . \\nwas i grossed out ? \\nyes . \\ndid i get spooked a few times ? \\nyes . \\nbut why ? \\ni get really disturbed when there is no why . \\nwhen there weren\\'t random scares that were there for no other reason than for the visual effect ( which wasn\\'t that good either , trust me ) and the scare , the film was filled with drab , laughable dialogue . \\nthe characters were incredibly flat and cliched . \\nnot to mention downright annoying . \\nyou\\'ve got a bunch of people going nowhere in their lives ; of course they\\'re dumb enough to go to a party some stranger invited them to provided they win a million dollars if they survive the night . \\njeez , i thought no one fell for those \" you may already be a winner \" things anymore . \\nand of course , all three gals are babes . \\ni wonder how on earth the geoffrey rush of \" shine \" ended up in this movie . \\nkeep that up , geoff , and you\\'ll qualify for the next batman venture . \\nthe only single person i enjoyed was chris kattan because , well , he just cracks me up . \\nand famke jansen ( sp ? ) \\nbecause she reminds me of the delectable brosnan . \\npierce brosnan ( hey , i willingly endured \" dante\\'s peak \" three times for him : ) . \\nall right , i concede . \\nthere were a couple of things i enjoyed . \\nthat perverted little amusement park at the beginning . \\ni probably won\\'t ride a rollercoaster for a while . \\nand the machine they used to drive geoffrey\\'s character mad ( see , i don\\'t even remember their names ) . \\nthe machine , not that stupid fishtank with naked wimmin in it . \\ni kept waiting and waiting for that inevitable twist at the end of the movie . \\nit wouldn\\'t have redeemed the film , but at least it would have made me feel better . \\nbut no , they opted for the beautiful sunrise ending . \\nthank god they didn\\'t add a kiss at the end or i would have puked . \\ngod , there is no hope . \\n',\n",

       " b'call it a road trip for the walking wounded . \\nstellan skarsg ? rd plays such a convincingly zombified drunken loser that it\\'s difficult to spend nearly two hours of screen time in his smelly , boozed-out presence . \\nyet this ever-reliable swedish actor adds depth and significance to the otherwise plodding and forgettable aberdeen , a sentimental and painfully mundane european drama . \\nplaywright august strindberg built his career on families and relationships paralyzed by secrets , unable to express their longings until the hour is far too late . \\nthat\\'s an accurate reflection of what aberdeen strives for , focusing on the pairing of an alcoholic father , tomas ( skarsg ? rd ) and his alienated , openly hostile yuppie daughter , kaisa ( lena headey , gossip ) . \\nthey haven\\'t spoken in years , and wouldn\\'t even be making the long trip from norway to aberdeen , scotland by automobile if it weren\\'t for kaisa\\'s mother ( charlotte rampling , under the sand ) rotting away in a hospital bed from cancer . \\nin a soap opera twist , mother has only a few days to live . \\n ( only in the movies , right ? ) \\ntoo blitzed to even step foot on a plane , tomas hits the open road with kaisa . \\nloathing each other all the while , they make periodic stops for tomas to puke on the dashboard or pass out -- whenever he isn\\'t muttering what a rotten kid she turned out to be . \\ndespite his sloshed viewpoint , tomas recognizes that the apple hasn\\'t fallen very far from the tree . \\nkaisa gets nosebleeds from snorting coke , sabotages her personal relationships through indifference , and is unable to restrain her quick and vindictive temper . \\nain\\'t they a pair ? \\nunable to find true notes of unspoken familial empathy in the one-note and repetitively bitchy dialogue , screenwriters kristin amundsen and hans petter moland fabricate a series of contrivances to propel events forward -- lost money , roving street hooligans looking for drunks to kick around , nosy cops , and flat tires all figure into the schematic and convenient narrative . \\nby the time they reach the hospital , it\\'s time to unveil the secrets from a dark past that are not only simplistic devices that trivialize the father-daughter conflict , they\\'re also the mainstays of many a bad strindberg wannabe . \\nthis revelation exists purely for its own sake . \\naberdeen doesn\\'t know where else to go . \\nweak , unimaginative casting thwarts the pivotal role of kaisa . \\nif lena headey were a stronger actress , perhaps aberdeen could have been able to coast on the performances and moody , haunting cinematography ( rendering norway into its own pastoral ghost world -- the reference to a certain superior american indie flick intentional ) . \\nheadey\\'s too busy acting , using her face and furrowed brow to convey every last twitch of insouciance . \\nif she were paying any attention to skarsg ? rd , maybe she\\'d figure out that doing less can reveal so much more . \\nit\\'s worthwhile to compare aberdeen to an earlier film released in 2001 , jonathan nossiter\\'s captivating signs & wonders . \\nit\\'s not just because skarsg ? rd and rampling played disturbed parental figures in both films ( they\\'re not bound by ceremonial wedlock in aberdeen ) . \\nthe differences in the way their characters were presented is significant . \\nin aberdeen , rampling is a luminous diva , preening and static in her hospital bed . \\ndespite skarsg ? rd\\'s solid performance as tomas , his pathetic drunk is never given much of a chance to emote anything besides catatonic sorrow . \\nthere\\'s genuine ferocity and sexually charged frisson during their understated confrontations in signs & wonders , allowing them to suggest a gray zone of complications that accompany torn romance and years of stifled curiosity . \\nnossiter\\'s film thoroughly explores this neurotic territory in addition to delving into the americanization of greece and the use of mysticism as an illusion to deflect pain . \\nif signs & wonders sometimes feels overloaded with ideas , at least it\\'s willing to stretch beyond what we\\'ve come to expect from traditional drama . \\naberdeen is never half so ambitious , content to sleepwalk through the rhythms and timing of other movies . \\nwhen did character driven stories stop paying attention to the complexities of real life ? \\nthe depressing answer can be found in lawrence kasdan\\'s trite but occasionally useful grand canyon , where steve martin\\'s hollywood mogul pronounces , \" all of life\\'s riddles are answered in the movies ! \" \\neven foreign films are taking that advice to heart . \\n',\n",
       " b'any remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project , as a perfect murder illustrates . \\nfrankly , dial m for murder is not one of the master director\\'s greatest efforts , so there is ample room for improvement . \\nunfortunately , instead of updating the script , ironing out some of the faults , and speeding up the pace a little , a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder , leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be \\'90s thriller . \\nalmost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities . \\nthe best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in what\\'s going on so that these flaws in logic don\\'t become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled . \\nunfortunately , in a perfect murder , the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as they\\'re happening . \\nthis is a very bad sign . \\nnot only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief , but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder . \\nof course , in the case of a perfect murder , at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless , cardboard characters . \\na perfect murder isn\\'t a strict remake of dial m for murder , but it does borrow heavily from frederick knott\\'s play ( which was also the source material for hitchcock\\'s version , as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) . \\nemily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) . \\ntheir marriage isn\\'t going well -- emily resents steven\\'s controlling instincts , and , as a form of rebellion , she is having an affair with a penniless painter , david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) . \\nwhen steven learns of the relationship , he decides to confront david , but his approach isn\\'t that of a typical cuckolded husband . \\ninstead of yelling or threatening , steven offers david a proposal that\\'s too good to resist : for $500 , 000 in cash ( $100 , 000 before , the rest after ) , he is to break into steven\\'s new york apartment and kill emily . \\n ( of course , after getting the first payment , david never bothers to ask how he\\'s supposed to get the rest . ) \\nultimately , i\\'m not sure which of the three main characters we\\'re supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband , who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover , who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman , who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair . \\nnot only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable , but they\\'re not interesting . \\n ( it\\'s possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them , which , in this case , there isn\\'t . ) \\nsteven , emily , and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes . \\nthe actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks . \\nmichael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- he\\'s gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife . \\ngwyneth paltrow , who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors , is simply awful here . \\nshe now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998\\'s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) . \\nat least viggo mortensen ( g . i . \\njane ) has a little fun with his part , but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies . \\nthe thin supporting cast includes david suchet , the star of \" poirot , \" as a police inspector , and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emily\\'s best friend . \\na perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end . \\nthere aren\\'t many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script , which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start . \\nit\\'s surprising to see director andrew davis , the man behind the fugitive , involved in this mess , but , like his stars , he too needs to earn a living . \\nit\\'s just that remaking hitchcock , and doing it so badly , hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough . \\n',\n",
       " b'after having heard so many critics describe \" return to me \" as an old-fashioned hollywood romance , i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ? \\nwhat made \" return to me \" old-fashioned and old-hollywood ? \\nwas it the tunes from sinatra , etc . , legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ? \\nwas it the glamorous , sophisticated feel ? \\nthe charisma of the two leads ? \\neven now i can\\'t say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer , because i haven\\'t see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances . \\ni don\\'t think any of the romances i\\'ve seen have been classified as such . \\nwhich leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics -- \" return to me \" was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic , the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider . \\nit was traditional , magical . \\nwe knew it couldn\\'t be too daring , or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in . \\nit was a romance told with such endearing simplicity , tenderness , and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldn\\'t help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings . \\nthe film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunt\\'s direction . \\nfrom the very first bird\\'s eye view of chicago , zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny ) , accompanied by the \" return to me \" ballad ( by whom ? ) , we can tell we\\'re in for something sweet . \\nthe scenes between the characters are endearing , truthful , with just a hint of fantasy . \\nreal people don\\'t act that way ; real people aren\\'t that nice . \\nwe know all this , and yet we want to believe in these folks\\' existence . \\nthe premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale , but hunt\\'s rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal . \\neverything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film . \\n>from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bob\\'s wardrobes . \\nfrom the eloquent , not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints . \\nfrom the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part . \\n \" return to me \" has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist . \\nwe care for them , laugh with them , cry with them ; we\\'re concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father . \\nwhatever hunt did , she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors . \\ndisappointingly , david alan grier\\'s charlie , however much i like him , was the most flatly-written . \\nduchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder . \\ninstead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of \" the x-files . \" \\nduchovny , who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen . \\nminnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet , innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer . \\nthough an unlikely pair , duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses . \\nwhile \" return to me \" functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy , a romantic scenic tour through chicago , and a tearjerker , the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop . \\nthe entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wife\\'s heart . \\nwe already know that there\\'s going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film , however enjoyably , in a straight line going towards that point . \\nas a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes , i know she\\'s supposed to have his ex-wife\\'s heart and everything--it seems too effortless . \\nthe main subject is a love story , and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) . \\nhowever , in the spirit of \" return to me , \" it won\\'t do to be too picky about how \" old \" hollywood tells its stories . \\ni loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt . \\nit shows . \\nthe bottom line : \" return to me \" is nothing remarkable , and yet its sweetness , sincerity , and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadn\\'t imagined . \\n',\n",

       " b'like a good action film should , \" metro \" has action that keeps you involved . \\nsome action films have action sequences that are so conventional , our attention is detracted and diverted by other thoughts . \\n \" the ghost in the darkness , \" which opened a few months ago , is a film that s action was so bland and uninvolving , it not only invited my thoughts to divert me , it nearly put me asleep . \\nbut \" metro \" is one of the best action films in a while . \\nit is hip , sharp , nifty , and has nice little pieces of suspense and comedy . \\neddie murphy was in bad shape for a while . \\nand this invites me to mention last year s \" the nutty professor , \" which was his blessed revival back to the position at which he used to be . \\n \" metro \" happens to be a lot better than any film in the \" beverly hills cop \" series . \\nthat is because \" metro \" takes itself seriously , but doesn t prevent itself from having a little fun . \\neddie murphy is at his best in the roles of responsible , and controlled people . \\nthe \" beverly hills cop \" movies all featured eddie as a reckless , wild cop , always crossing the line by just an inch . \\nin \" metro \" he plays a hostage negotiator , so negotiation is his job , not his hobby or his preferred way out of trouble . \\nhis character in \" metro \" takes himself seriously . \\neddie murphy s mischievous trademark grin is hardly anywhere to be found in \" metro , \" and perhaps it is quite better off that way . \\nmurphy plays scott roper , and as i previously mentioned , he is a san francisco hostage negotiator . \\nin the first tense situation in the film , we are introduced to roper s kind of work , as he tries to calm down a confused , unkempt young criminal who has taken captive the entire capacity of the san francisco bank he is holding up . \\nmurphy handles the scene seriously , without his usual happy-go-lucky , misfit humor . \\nthe film develops when its villain is established , and the villain here is the beguiling michael korda , a jewel thief , and murderer who likes to let cops know of his hostage fatalities by giving them the ear of the victim . \\n \" metro \" takes different twists and slight turns , and there is one great , virtuoso chase scene , involving the a cable car . \\ncars flip . \\ncars crash . \\ncars turn over . \\nand it is done so good in this film , i was reminded of \" speed , \" and the speeding bus that couldn t go under fifty mile per hour for very significant reasons . \\nthere are also some other good scenes in \" metro \" that a lot of films would rather choose not to have . \\nscenes like the one with roper and his new partner are at the horse track roper is a gambler who knows all the tricks and roper teaches his partner a few little methods of betting and winning . \\nof course , the writers tried to disguise the scene as being insignificant by having roper draw parallels between hostage negotiation and gambling . \\nthe scenes between roper and his girlfriend are nice , too . \\nthose are the scenes that make up \" metro , \" which is mainly about eddie murphy s maturing as a personality . \\nthe actor that i most enjoyed seeing in \" metro \" was michael rapaport , who plays roper s new partner , a lip-reading , book-skimming genius , and a master of observation . \\nit was not the actor s presence that pleased me as much as the role he was cast in the role of a proclaimed genius . \\nrapaport is an actor who i usually see in the role of the dimwit the really , really dopey dimwit . \\ni hardly recognized him in \" metro , \" and it was quite a joy to be able to see him in a role like this i feel that i respect him more . \\nthere are two main types of villains in movies like this : the ones that are part of the story , and the ones that are devices . \\nthe villain in \" metro \" is no more than a device , but he is a darn good villain nonetheless . \\nhe is played by michael wincott , whose voice is pushed out in a abraded rasp , as if he smokes a cigarette between every take . \\nwincott makes his villain , korda , as mean as could be , the classic type of villain who would push an old lady down a flight of stairs just for kicks , like richard widmark in \" kiss of death . \" \\nand , in addition , wincott s physical appearance and mannerisms , in the film , actually reminded my of an arrogant friend i use to have , who is no longer on my good list . \\ni liked \" metro , \" and i do not think would have worked with any other actor but eddie murphy . \\nhis past roles were the great ones but they were also a precursor to the maturing that would later take place , possibly from murphy s growing as a person , now having a family . \\n \" metro \" is a no-nonsense movie . \\nit works as a buddy movie , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a dry comedy , which it does not overplay . \\nit works as a suspense film , which it does not overplay . \\nand it works as an action film , where it does have a tendency to occasionally go all-out . \\nbut who cares ? \\nit still remains serious , and it does not overdo itself . \\noh , and there were plenty of explosions in \" metro , \" as well . \\nhow nice it was of the filmmakers to give us those . \\nif there is one major objection i had to \" metro \" , it was the length , an area where a lot of action films seem to wear out their welcomes . \\n \" metro \" is a film that lasted a little too long , but it was still entertaining , and it gave me something to do while i waited

       " b'i can\\'t recall a previous film experience where the fairly good time i was having turned as sour as quickly as it did during feeling minnesota . \\nfor forty minutes or so , i was lured into a loopy if occasionally over-wrought romantic comedy , and i was even giving keanu reeves the benefit of the doubt . \\nthen , rather suddenly , i was clubbed over the head with a nasty bit of violence ; shortly thereafter , i was whacked in the gut by another . \\nfeeling minnesota is a film that made me feel violated , as though i had trusted writer-director steven baigelman to bring me a cool glass of water and instead he threw acid in my face . \\nfeeling minnesota tells the story of a topless dancer named freddie ( cameron diaz ) who finds herself in deep trouble when her boss red ( delroy lindo ) suspects her of stealing from him . \\nred\\'s punishment is to force freddie to marry his bookkeeper , sam clayton ( vincent d\\'onofrio ) , who is far from the man of freddie\\'s dreams . \\nenter jjaks ( keanu reeves ) , sam\\'s estranged younger brother , who arrives at the wedding just in time to catch freddie\\'s eye and have sex with her in the bathroom . \\nunited in their mutual attraction and their mutual loathing of sam , jjaks and freddie take off together , but sam isn\\'t ready to let them go without a fight . \\nfreddie , meanwhile , isn\\'t ready to let sam\\'s money go without a fight , and thus begins a series of violent confrontations . \\nthere is both style and substance to the beginning of feeling minnesota , as baigelman opens with an effective montage showing jjaks and sam\\'s intense sibling rivalry as boys , and their mother ( tuesday weld ) sending jjaks away to live with his father . \\nit does a great job of setting up jjaks\\' unstable life , a life which has landed him in trouble for petty crimes and always trying to please his family ; reeves\\' wounded look is just right for jjaks . \\nthe wedding sequence includes a number of nice moments , most notably the aforementioned bathroom scene in which a simple question is given a very funny spin . \\nmost important , baigelman begins to establish the connection between freddie and jjaks with humor and economy , as in a scene where they both spontaneously begin singing along to the replacements\\' \" i will dare \" on the car radio . \\nyou would have every reason to expect that relationships -- both familial and romantic -- would be the focal point of feeling minnesota . \\nunfortunately , you would be dead wrong . \\ni suppose i should have expected daisies and valentines after an early scene in which red threatens freddie as she tries to avoid the wedding , but i certainly didn\\'t expect what i got . \\nwhat i got was yet another in a long line of recent films trying to ride the tarantino wave by mixing gags and brutality , or rather creating gags about brutality . \\nsuddenly , the story of romantic entanglements and family conflict becomes a story about a corpse , and everything which had come before degenerates so completely that virtually nothing is recognizable . \\nthe sibling rivalry not only becomes little more than an excuse for one round of beatings after another , but there is no consistency to the characterizations . \\nvincent d\\'onofrio turns in a manic performance as sam , whose jealousy , competitiveness and apparent sense of inferiority seem far more in keeping with what we know about jjaks , while reeves turns into a framed hero too reminiscent of chain reaction , and both of them spend most of the second half of the film screaming and covered in blood . \\nthere are films which have managed to employ a radical shift in tone successfully ( jonathan demme\\'s something wild and neil jordan\\'s the crying game come to mind ) , but they didn\\'t try to draw an audience with the promise of relatively innocuous entertainment . \\ni don\\'t want to dismiss baigelman\\'s successes out of hand -- he gets a fun performance out of dan aykroyd as a crooked cop , and some well-crafted comic moments -- and it is not his fault that fine line has chosen to promote feeling minnesota as a light-hearted caper . \\nit _is_ his fault that he violates his own characters for the sake of shock value , and that he can\\'t make his two halves into a whole . \\nfeeling minnesota left me feeling used , and there\\'s not much funny about that . \\n',\n",

       " b'it\\'s an interesting premise . \\nour reality is only real to us because it is what we perceive to be real . \\nin truth , our entire existences are lived out in our minds as we are fed information through electronic inputs directly to our brains . \\nwhat we see , what we do , everything around us is nothing more than a computer-generated construct interlinked with the minds of others through a vastly powerful artificial intelligence . \\nour bodies , severely atrophied , are kept alive for the sole purpose of generating heat and electrical energy for a dominating order of machines which control the planet . \\nthe sci-fi realm has been waiting a little while for something new to come along . \\nthe matrix isn\\'t it - the idea of a war between man and a sentient computer network , a sham world , the ability to plug one\\'s brain into a computer , has all been gleaned from such sources as the terminator , dark city , and a few star trek episodes ( both classic and next generation ) . \\nwhat is new is the ability to weave all of these various elements together and succeed in producing a film that is both entertaining as well as thought-provoking . \\nkeanu reeves plays a computer whiz nicknamed neo , who is plucked out of the artificial world ( known as the matrix ) by a group of renegade humans who are clandestinely fighting to expose the fallacy of the computer-generated existence and free humankind from the oppression of the machines . \\nthe group\\'s leader , morpheus ( laurence fishburne ) , has chosen neo because he believes neo is \" the one \" who is destined to lead the attack against the artificial intelligence . \\n>from the beginning of the film , we are kept on our toes trying to figure things out . \\nthis , in a lesser movie would be annoying , but the matrix presents itself in an intelligent manner which makes the puzzle rather interesting and even fun . \\nwhat is reality ? \\nwhat is a sham ? \\nthe film turns our very perception of life on its side . \\nmore than once , we are also presented with the question of whether we would rather know the harsh truth of reality , or live a life of relative bliss , oblivious to the true nature of our surroundings . \\nas viewers , this is intriguing enough , so imagine what it would be like for neo . \\nand who to better play a bewildered person than keanu reeves ? \\nreeves , whom i\\'ve never really cared for as an actor , is competent in roles which require a lot of straightforwardness , and little subtlety . \\nhe was good in speed , for example , but laughably poor in a walk in the clouds . \\nneo is actually one of those roles which reeves slips into rather nicely , so much of my expectation was happily for naught . \\nin a couple of places , the script even capitalizes upon his wooden nature , and this is a heavy credit to writers/directors andy and larry wachowski . \\ni mean , since bill and ted\\'s excellent adventure , what movie could you say really \" utilized \" keanu reeves ? \\nmore interesting than reeves is fishburne , who\\'s morpheus nearly runs the gamut of emotions , and convincingly so . \\nvery surprising for a sci-fi movie . \\nfishburne also maintains a certain demeanor about himself throughout , as if he always knows what to expect . \\nthis helps to further the aura of his character\\'s proficiency and extensive knowledge . \\nhugo weaving as agent smith , one of the artificial intelligence\\'s anti-intruder programs , is also good playing his deadpan , no-nonsense , kick ass role , which requires him to show emotion at the appropriate time . \\nunfortunately , when weaving speaks for more than a few sentences in a row , the nature of his character\\'s speech pattern becomes a little more laughable than impressive . \\ncarrie-anne moss plays trinity , morpheus\\'s number one assistant who becomes somewhat of a love interest for neo . \\nalthough her character is somewhat inconsistent , moss nevertheless delivers an above par performance when fishburne isn\\'t in the picture . \\nthere were few expenses spared when it comes to the special effects . \\nmany methods of imagery are employed , from modeling to bluescreen to computer graphics . \\nof special note is the use of the \" freeze and turn \" effect where the entire scene is frozen , turned , then continued from a new angle . \\nthis is accomplished by using a large number of still cameras employed in a semi-circle , with motion picture cameras placed at the two ends . \\nthe motion cameras film the action , and at the appropriate moment all the still cameras fire at once . \\nplace each still image in a film sequence and you get a nearly seamless transition from the first motion camera to the second . \\npretty slick . \\nthe matrix drips with style . \\nfrom the clothing to the music to the action , we\\'re watching an exaggerated version of what we\\'re used to . \\nmuch of it seems like the combination of two genres of the hong kong action film - there\\'s a lot of kung fu , there\\'s a lot of gunplay . \\nwhen a character is letting go with an automatic weapon , much is made of the empty cartridges falling to the floor in slow motion . \\nthere\\'s also the element of the japanese action cartoon ( called anime by aficionados ) , especially in the way the sequences are filmed in sweeping pans and emphasized actions through special effects . \\ncombined , it\\'s really like no live-action film i have ever seen . \\nthe film is not without its faults . \\nsome of the scenes and ideas are \" borrowed \" a little too liberally from other films , and one component of the ending is decidedly disappointing . \\nsome of the lines are also pretty bad - in one instance , a supporting character incorrectly delivers a famous saying , and it wasn\\'t meant to be a joke . \\nhowever , these shortcomings detract little from what is an overall solid action sci-fi film that for once does more than merely entertain . \\n',\n",

       " b\"8mm , written by seven scribe andrew kevin walker , has an interesting idea which is ruined by hollywood formula to become a bog standard murder mystery . \\nnicolas cage plays family man detective tom welles , who is asked by upper class toff mrs . christian ( myra carter ) to investigate an movie found in her recently deceased husbands safe . \\nthe movie happens to be an mythical 'snuff movie' , where the girl featured in the film appears to get brutally slashed . \\nall mrs . christian wants to know if the girl in the film was killed or not . \\nwelles agrees , and soon gets pulled into the seedy underworld of porn movies , with video clerk max california ( phoenix ) as his guide . \\nalthough the 'snuff' industry hasn't really been examined in mainstream cinema , 8mm still makes a rather plodding thriller which just seems to be a bit sicker than most . \\nthe snuff movie within the movie is certainly disturbing , although the jerky camera angles and grainy image takes some of the shock away . \\n8mm has the problem of not wanting to shock too much , and apart from a few moments , most of the action in the film is nothing you haven't seen from another standard thriller . \\nthe cast help towards the entertainment , apart from an hideous performance by the increasingly lazy nicolas cage . \\nwhile he was fun and breezy in earlier films such as raising arizona ( 1987 ) , ever since leaving las vegas ( 1995 ) , cage has lost much of his acting talent and appears to be on autopilot , such as in the terrible snake eyes ( 1998 . ) \\nhere , in 8mm , he's boring , uninteresting and has a dull monotonous voice . \\nand in this overlong thriller , these virtues do not help keep the suspense up . \\nonly when cage is onscreen with the excellent phoenix does the film start moving , as phoenix is a true talent . \\nhis performance is a great break away from the gloom , and he's just purely enjoyable to watch . \\ncatherine keener is completely wasted as cage's wife , although she delivers a far better performance than her character deserves . \\nher character , though , is hugely underwritten , one of the most wasted characters of the year . \\nalso fun is fargo's peter stormare as the wildly over the top snuff film director . \\nas this film is written by the person behind seven , 8mm is filled with doom and gloom , and no-one appears to know how to use an light switch . \\nunlike seven , 8mm isn't too clever , and the twist is pathetic and startlingly obvious when it arrives . \\nlacking the strong characters seven featured , 8mm ultimately becomes uninvolving plot wise , and relies on the graphic scenes to provide any entertainment . \\nbut director joel schumacher , the completely wrong guy for the job , puts style over content , and while the direction and look are good , it's just not very disturbing . \\nschumacher also has no idea how to shock and audience , and though we are meant to be looking at the 'dark belly' of the porn industry , it doesn't exactly leave an haunting impression on the viewers mind , which misses the point . \\nalso , the last 20 minutes are so hackneyed , so cliched , it's amazing to think it's the same film you're watching . \\n8mm is far from an success , a 'snuffed' opportunity . \\nwith a boring lead character , 'controversial' scenes that manage not to be controversial , and a director obsessed with looks , what could have been one of the most shocking films of the year is a dumb thriller . \\nultimately , 8mm is probably worth renting on home video , unless your desperate to see what the snuff film within the film looks like . \\nand trust me , the rest of the 2 hours are not worth it . \\n\",\n",
       " b'allen , star of many a brian depalma movie in the early eighties , has a brief , throwaway part towards the end of \" out of sight , \" as the maid of a crooked financier . \\nin keeping with her past performances , allen wears little more than a green velvet victoria\\'s secret ensemble which begs the question , did they really need a costume designer for this ? \\n \" out of sight \" is not likely to secure ms . allen the kind of plaudits bestowed upon pam grier , who likewise returned from out of obscurity to appear in another recent elmore leonard adaptation , \" jackie brown , \" but it is intriguing to see her name kicking off the \" also starring \" credits given her limited screen time . \\nthe real stars of \" out of sight \" are george clooney ( \" batman & robin \" by way of \" e . r . \" ) and jennifer lopez ( \" selena \" ) , whose winning chemistry , coupled with steven soderbergh\\'s freeze-frame directorial technique , help the film retain the charismatic charm of leonard\\'s original work . \\nwith the success of \" get shorty \" three years ago , filmmakers have realized that adapting an elmore leonard novel can be an easier proposition than trying to dream up a storyline from scratch . \\nin \" out of sight , \" clooney stars as jack foley , a career criminal who specializes in unarmed robbery--he just waltzes into banks and politely makes a withdrawal , claiming that his \" partner \" ( just another customer it so happens ) will shoot the manager if the teller doesn\\'t comply . \\nfor all of jack\\'s nice-guy charm though , he\\'s not very lucky . \\nhis latest scam lands him in florida\\'s glades correctional facility . \\nfederal marshal karen sisco ( lopez ) coincidentally arrives at the prison just as jack and his buddy ( ving rhames , typically appealing ) are breaking out . \\nthere\\'s a brief struggle and jack bundles himself and karen into the trunk of the getaway car . \\nit\\'s in these cramped confines , pressed intimately together , that jack and karen start falling for one another . \\nthe mutual attraction continues as the couple on opposite sides of the law slip in and out of one another\\'s grasp . \\nkaren follows jack to detroit , where he\\'s about to pull off another heist , this time a cache of uncut diamonds from incarcerated businessman richard ripley ( played by a toupee-sporting albert brooks , almost unrecognizable in the prison scenes ) . \\nit\\'s during this final caper-gone-awry that allen makes her scant appearance . \\nclooney\\'s range as an actor is limited , but he has undeniable charm . \\nlopez , too , is easy on the eyes , but she demonstrates more depth in her portrayal of karen , a tough yet tender professional . \\nshe dispenses with hit men as easily as she out-maneuvers sleazy pick-up artists in a bar . \\nespecially cute is a sequence in which karen fantasizes about jack in a motel bathtub . \\nadmirably supporting clooney and lopez are don cheadle as fellow felon maurice \\'snoopy\\' miller , steve zahn as the perennially stoned glenn michaels , and dennis farina as karen\\'s dad , who affectionately buys her a piece . \\nadd a couple of uncredited cameos from \" jackie brown \" cast members and \" out of sight \" proves to be a lot of fun . \\nnot as hip and clever as \" shorty , \" perhaps , or as complex and colorful as \" brown , \" but loads of fun nonetheless . \\n',\n",

       " b'this is a film about secrets , some that are innocent like those of a cute little farm girl , frances boyd ( ashley ) . \\nothers that are between a married couple that is impacting their relationship , like the problems of infertility affecting this upwardly mobile couple , geoffrey gaines ( stephen ramsey ) , the medical researcher working for a big corporation called fex and striving to get a patent for his experiment and become recognized in his field , and his artist wife , lillian ( miriam healy-louie ) , who reluctantly stands behind her husband suppressing her natural artistic tendencies in order to make the marriage work . \\nand , still other secrets that have a greater implication for the world and are deadly in a political sense , of science carried out by the big corporations like it was a business run for the bottom line . \\nreceiving a summer grant to study \" chemo-electric therapy , \" geoffrey and his wife are hoping that a summer spent away from the intensity of the big city will bring back the romance that is dwindling from their marriage and that the casualness of the country atmosphere will give them more time together , as their three-year marriage has become shaky because he is more interested in his work than he is in her . \\nhe has slyly managed to keep his work as secretive as possible by locking himself in the lab , which is off limits to her , as he secretly goes about conducting experiments on rats and mice , convincing her that what he is doing is to benefit humanity with possible new treatments and cures to illnesses . \\nhis main argument is , that this is what the public wants , they don\\'t want to hear about how some animals had to die because of these experiments , they just want the benefits of science . \\nthat he is depicted as a monster creating another monster , much like frankenstein was created , is the argument skewed by the director against his bad science ( science as a business ) as opposed to the good science ( science that cares about the small farmer ) , which is represented by the handsome and almost perfect gentleman , alex vine ( david ) , a young ecologist who chooses to work in the field , trying to get the farmers to go back to organic farming . \\nhe is hired by the university to monitor the dangers of pesticides and all the chemicals the farmer is almost forced to use to survive financially , as it is doing irreparable harm to him and the consumer because of all the health risks attached to this new way of farming , methods that have just come about in the last thirty- years and are being pushed by the big companies to enhance their profit margins . \\nthe third view in all this is the artist\\'s , represented by lillian , who points out that the artist\\'s work is shown in public and scrutinized constantly , \" why shouldn\\'t the same be true of the scientist ? \" \\nshe argues that the artist is the watchdog for the public , questioning what is good or evil in society , something that bad science has completely ignored . \\ngeoffrey , impatient to get ahead with his research , feels bogged down by the bureaucrats in his firm who fail to provide him with the three chimps he needs to experiment on , as he contacts one of the company\\'s higher ups to argue his case , but decides he can\\'t wait any longer for their help , so he sets an animal trap in the countryside and catches chester , the gorgeous pet dog of frances , a dog that means so much to her and her family because he saved her life . \\nwhile out in the field with the bloodied trapped dog already in the back seat of his car , he is spotted by alex and one of his co-workers , and nervously invites them to dinner with his wife , afraid that alex will spot what he is doing , as he rushes away from the area . \\nin the dinner scene that was , unfortunately , flatly done , but was nevertheless the heart of the film , as all the main characters get a chance to speak out from the point of view they represent as they eat meat , a means of getting protein that the radical scientists have eschewed since they became so politically correct about everything . \\nthe scientists engage in a rational argument , highlighting their different points of view , while lillian reacts in an emotional way , siding mostly with david\\'s view but coming at it from a much different angle . \\nit was as if the actors were puppets on strings that the director controlled and they just spewed out their generalized philosophies . \\nthat the director\\'s point of view is absolutely right , is beside the point . \\nthe point is that the characters lost their humanity and became one-dimensional characters . \\ngeoffrey was likened to a hideous monster , alex vine was likened to his last name , the one who holds fast to the ground ensuring that the plant has stability , while lillian was likened to the muse of poetry and art , the inspiration for goodness and beauty . \\nalex has been spending a lot of time together with lillian , as these two seem to share the same views and are physically attracted to each other , but when the time is ripe for an affair to take place between them , lillian changes her mind and decides not to go up to alex\\'s apartment . \\ngeoffrey is already suspicious of alex and considers him an enemy , and the marriage seems to be coming apart and all his cunning tricks to possess her are no longer working , as it is now impossible to see any good in him and there becomes no reason why she would remain with him . \\nthe relationship has disintegrated way beyond the point of her just feeling lonely . \\nthe dog is discovered by alex and her in a deplorable state after geoffrey is seen by them electrically shocking it , and mercifully the dog dies . \\nthe only thing left for her to do is walk out of the marriage , but she also fails to respond to david\\'s loving gesture for her to stay with him , instead opting to head back to the city . \\nthe farmer whose dog was tortured to death comes into the scientist\\'s lab and knocks him cold while he was in the middle of a phone conversation with one of the higher-ups who told him all the animals he needs are on the way . \\nwhat is progress ? \\nwhat can one expect out of life ? \\nis the small farmer about to become extinct ? \\nthe answers to these questions can best be answered by either good science or art , which are both closely related to the american natives vision of a world entrusted to mankind so that he can respect it and take care of it and enrich it with his creations to benefit mankind in a peaceful way . \\nthat this work fails to be subtle and polarizes opinions , leaving no room for deeper arguments , is the shame of this decent and smart film , that tried so hard to say what it felt it had to say but said it so loudly without trusting its audience to catch on to its message by not making everything seem so black and white . \\nno telling said a lot about the harmful trends it sees science going in ; it probably said too much and would have been better off if its vision was more poetical and less didactic . \\nthere is something about listening to a lecture that turns off the rebel in me , as i don\\'t like being hit in the head with the truth but prefer to have it presented in the form that leads to inspiration or told metaphorically . \\nthat is not to say that i found the film without considerable merit , that inspite of its shortcomings , it was worth seeing because of its visual statements , though they were also not too subtle , they were at least effective in setting up the intense mood that the film needed to show that there is a mental war going on currently , of those who believe one way is right and others who differ with them , and that anyone who is neutral must be considered an enemy because of their indifference . \\nthe stakes in this ecological struggle are that high . \\nperhaps the most powerful visual statement in the film , was the dead cow from pesticides shown in the opening scene . \\nit was the image that lillian spent her time painting all summer and had the same affect for her as did the animal faces in picasso\\'s guernica had for him . \\nboth artists envisioned the horrors that man could do against the world , and represented this unspoken pain on the faces of the animals so that anyone who cares to really see what is going on , will not mistake which side of the fence he or she should be on . \\nthe pain that lillian feels , as she forgets about her desires to raise a family , and she stares at her painting of the cow and the song , \" make the world go away \" blares out from the background , after she has learned that frances\\' beautiful and loving dog has been brutalized by her monster of a husband , all in the name of science , had a raw power to it that personalizes the dangers of bad science . \\nperhaps , the most pertinent question the film asks , requires an answer that must be resolved by the farmers and the consumers who are most caught in the changing world and its new way of doing business , as the question becomes , can science be happily married with art ?

       " b\"well there goes another one . \\nsadly this like other movies this year wasn't good . \\nthis one being almost as bad as 'the omega code' but not quite . \\nfrom the opening credits i had a good feeling this would be bad , and well i guess i was right . \\nwith bad excuses for acting , a horrible screenplay and straight-out bad direction 'the bachelor' is a terribly unfunny movie that doesn't work on any levels accept that fact that rene zellwegar who does give a good performance . \\nthe two cameos by brooke shields and mariah carey are also good with brooke being the best . \\nthe movie is troubled from the start because chris o'donnell is hugely miscast and gives one of the worst performances to date . \\nhere is the stupid plot : chris o'donnell plays jimmie shelton a man who has just broken up with his girlfriend , he meets anne ( rene zellwegar ) they instantly hit it off and are together for three years . \\njimmie decides that he wants to bring their relationship a little bit up . \\nhe really doesn't realize that anne thinks he wants to marry her ( what he wants i never did catch ) . \\nso he proposes in a really bad way , and she shoots him down and is very mad . \\nhe of course tries to apologize but nothing seems to help any . \\nthen his grandfather dies and he learns that he has left jimmie 100 million dollars . . . . as \\nlong as he marries before the next day at 6 : 05 pm . \\nnow jimmie must find anne and try to marry her to get the money and because he loves her , or get married to someone else to get the money itself , leading to an un-funny and predictable ending that leaves a bad taste in our mouths . \\nok so maybe this could be one of the dumbest , cliched , silliest romantic comedy to date that has no real big laughs . \\neven the supporting roles of artie lange , hal holbrook and ed anser aren't even good . \\nthe plot was a good idea , but the script would have to have been written in less than five minutes and by a five year old . \\nthe choppy dialogue and bad directing don't help things any . \\neven though chris o'donnell gave an ok performance in the two batman movies , he does not give even a remotely good or funny performance here and i wanted to boo and throw my pop at the screen to get rid of him . \\nrene zelweggar is a different story and gave a charming , sweet and likable performance ( as usual ) and really was the only thing that saved this confused movie from being a total huge washout . \\nher sister played by marley shelton is also good and the two have good chemistry onscreen . \\nbrooke shields showed up in a funny little performance as a big-headed mogul who after a while became routine and old . \\none really can't help but think that we have seen this stuff before . \\nit's not like this is an original idea and in the end , everyone knows what is going to happen due do its cliches and typicalness . \\n'the bachelor' works on no good levels and in fact doesn't work at all . \\ned anser and hal holbrook were wasted in terrible roles and mariah carey can not act to save her soul , and this could be the only film of her movie career dispite her terrific music career . \\nchris o'donnell is not as bad an actor as casper van dien but that is not saying a great deal . \\nhe seems held back and really doesn't get into his character much and after even the first 30 minutes gets annoying and old . \\nartie lange just to me seems like he is trying to another chris farley and was completely unfunny and un-nerving . \\nwhy the filmmakers would want to waste such a cast in such a bad movie , with such bad acting and dialogue is a question only they will know . \\nmaybe they thought it would become a hit or a critical success , and sometimes i don't agree with other critics on movies , even from the trailers for this film they made it look bad and showed all the mildly funny parts . \\nits based on the 1925 silent film 'seven chances' which i am sure is very better than this mess . \\neven though some may think of this as a good date movie , most who see this will want to pull out thier hair and scream for thier money back . \\nbesides being a terrible movie , 'the bachelor' is well a terrible movie . \\nit has nothing worth recommending therefore i really can't recommend this movie . \\ni did not have a good time and i laughed only three times . \\nthe running time of the movie is 106 minutes which is wayyyy over time and needs to be shortened at least thirty minutes . \\nparts of it seems to go on forever and parts of seem to not last enough time . \\nbeing one of the worst movies of the year , we can be sure that i hope they will not make anymore stupid unfunny romantic comedies , and if they do they i give up on filmmakers . \\n\",\n",

       " b'this is an adaptation of h . g . wells\\' acclaimed novel \\'the invisible man\\' . \\nthe actors are kevin beacon and elizabeth shue . \\nthe director is paul verhoven . \\nthat , plus a quick demonstration of the amazing special effects in the trailer , should be enough to lure us into the theatre . \\nthe problem is to keep us there . \\ni can\\'t imagine anyone who would like to see this movie a second time . \\nworking on a top secret military project , sebastian caine ( kevin beacon ) -- an eccentric genius , that calls himself \" god \" , has discovered the secret to invisibility . \\nthe first two faces are completed . \\nnow , it is time for \" the next logical step \" -- human . \\ncaine volunteers for this risky experiment . \\nbut when he is made invisible , something goes wrong . \\nwhile his ex-girlfriend linda ( elisabeth shue ) desperately tries to find something to return him to normal , he learns that invisibility is more of a prison than a superpower . \\nbut that\\'s not the bad thing -- an unexpected side-effect of the drug sends him careening into paranoid megalomania . \\nhe is naturally given a couple of modest superpowers , just enough for him to survive immolation from a flame thrower and an explosion of about a quart of nitroglycerine . \\nsoon every sense of decency is forgotten . \\nthe little intelligence that was left disappears as verhoven looses control and the film turns into an alien-rip-off , where caine is walking like a half finished terminator , spooking , scaring and killing everybody . \\nthough it\\'s based on a novel called \\'the invisible man\\' , the title has been ironically changed to \\'hollow man\\' that sums up the film very nicely . \\nthis is a very silly production . \\nlaughable , actually . \\napparently verhoven\\'s imagination doesn\\'t stretch too far . \\nfor him the only worthwhile reason to become invisible is so you can case the girls\\' locker room undetected . \\nit is this primitive schoolboy mentality that eventually kills the movie . \\nbeing invisible , gives you the opportunity to be who you are , to do what you want without being influenced by society . \\nin many ways it gives you an illusion of having a life without consequences . \\nthe nature of man and his place in society is what the novel is truly about . \\nall that , the depth and true horror of the book is gone and only special effects make you remain in your seat . \\ncaine does use his power voyeuristically in hollow man . \\nbut since this is a modernization , in other words a dehumanization , he doesn\\'t stop there . \\nhe becomes a rapist . \\nand then , of course , a murderer . \\nyou\\'ll start wondering why such actors as beacon and shue found themselves in such film in the first place . \\nshue\\'s talent is barely seen , josh brolin is underused and the rest of the cast suffer mostly for the lack of talent . \\nkevin beacon is the only one that performs gracefully . \\nhis face is not seen for the most part of the film , and the only way he exists is as a disembodied voice . \\nthere are times when his presence actually saves the film from being completely embarrassing . \\nin the end the effects are the only reason to see this film in the first place . \\nbeing probably the best technical achievement since \" jurassic park \" , they are absolutely amazing . \\nwe observe the layers of skin , muscle , tissue , and bone being peeled away as a body is slowly rendered invisible . \\nwe see a beating heart , inflating lungs , and veins pulsing with newly-pumped blood . \\nthere are a couple of inventive shots with smoke , fire , air and water , but are a few scenes like that worth attending a movie for ? \\nwhat is truly disturbing is that with a great book , talented actors and a grand budget , this could have been so much more . \\npretty much like jan de bont ( \" twister \" , \" haunting \" ) , paul verhoven has never made anything extraordinary . \\nhe was responsible for several good films ( \" basic instinct \" and \" starship troopers ) \" and some incredibly bad films ( \" showgirls \" , \" total recall \" ) , but he has never made anything that was great . \\nin a way \" hollow man \" fits perfectly in this collection . \\nit\\'s not better or worse than verhoven\\'s average film . \\nhe proves once again that he is incapable of handling more complex issues . \\nand so , instead of depth and chills , verhoven inserts some of his trademarks : stupid dialogue , and lot\\'s of dull action with blood and naked bodies . \\nhe even throws in some of the worst of film clich ? s - the slowly advancing fireball , the villain who comes back from the dead , etc , etc . - and tops the whole thing off with one of the most ridiculous endings of the year ( you\\'ll be screaming \" nooooo ! \" \\nand attempt to run towards the exit in slow motion ) . \\nand all we can ask is why ? \\nthe answer is simple . \\nthough hollywood is a movie producing machine , the business of moviemaking has to be about something more than money . \\nit has to be about telling stories , not marketing them . \\nit has to be about transporting us to a different place , to dazzle us with magic and cleverness . \\nto make us care , to make us think and feel . \\nverhoven has obviously missed that point and this film is a proof of that . \\nit\\'s all flesh and bones , but no soul . \\na void where its imagination should be . \\n',\n",
       " b'the crown jewel of 1970\\'s irwin allen disaster movies , the poseidon adventure features an all-star cast including gene hackman and ernest borgnine spouting some of the most laughable dramatic dialogue in movie history while trapped on a cruise ship . \\nthe story begins on the u . s . s . \\nposeidon\\'s big new year\\'s cruise , where we are introduced to the ensemble of people who will soon be the only passengers left alive . \\nlet\\'s see , there\\'s the new age preacher ( hackman ) who advises people to \" pray to that part of god within yourself . \" \\nthere\\'s the ex-cop ( borgnine ) who busted a hooker ( stella stevens ) six times -- then married her . \\nthere\\'s the hippie singer ( \" there\\'s got to be a morning after . . . \" ) who turns to the company of a lonely man ( red buttons ) once her brother is killed . \\nand to round out the group : the elderly couple ( jack albertson and shelley winters ) who live aboard the ship , the beautiful teenage girl and her brother who are sailing alone and adventurous scotsman roddy mcdowall . \\nwe get to know these people a little too well in the first thirty minutes of the poseidon adventure , before straight- faced ship captain leslie nielson looks in horror at the giant tidal wave headed right for the ship . \\neveryone\\'s in the giant ballroom at the time , shortly past midnight of the new year , when the ship turns first on its side , then completely upside down . \\nthe second- in-command wants everyone to wait in the ballroom until help arrives , but rebel hackman leads his small band of followers on a quest to the top of the ship . \\nin this case , because the ship is overturned , the top is the bottom . \\nor is the bottom the top ? \\neither way , we get to see a lot of bottoms because the two beautiful women in the crew are both conveniently wearing hot pants during the scenes where the camera shoots upwards while they climb up ladders and -- in the ballroom scene -- christmas trees . \\nthus begins an hour or more of hushed trips down long corridors , through burning rooms , etc . while the ship slowly fills with water behind them . \\nit\\'s a race against the clock which is only mildly interesting . \\nthe poseidon adventure works more as a bad movie to laugh at , with all the melodrama that comes in-between the non-thrilling action scenes . \\nthe one note in borgnine\\'s one-note performance is to be a cranky old man that argues with hackman every step of the way while buttons and the hippie fall in love ( although since there isn\\'t a sex scene , we never find out if his buttons really are red ) and albertson and winters wonder if they\\'ll live to see their grandson\\'s birth . \\nshelley winters provides the most hilarious scene in the movie in a scene toward the end , where water has flooded the next two rooms of the ship and hackman is preparing to dive under with a rope for the rest of them to pull along . \\nwinters , who has been the whiny fat woman throughout the movie ( stevens even not-so- affectionately calls her \" fatass \" in one scene ) , finally finds her purpose . \\n \" i was the underwater swimming champ of new york three years running when i was seventeen , \" she brags , and before hackman can even ask her how she could be seventeen for three years , she\\'s swimming through the water , her skirt billowing up around her hips , showing off her cellulite ( or do you call it shellulite ? ) \\nridden thighs . \\nit\\'s not so much funny as innately disgusting , which pretty much sums up the poseidon adventure as a whole . \\n',\n",
       " b\"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners . \\ncinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves . \\ntechnically , since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time , people like cinque couldn't be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave . \\nlawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men . \\nthree lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielberg's trademark panache - - flashy beginning , lots of facial close-ups , big music , and dramatic imagery . \\na final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters . \\nopinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life . \\nin fiction , one invents purposeful , clear-cut good guys and bad guys , puts the fictional characters in conflict , and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion . \\nreal life , however , consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around , think thoughts and do nothing , or come and go before events are resolved . \\nspielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story . \\ndjimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances . \\n\",\n",
       " b'the most amazing thing about paul cox\\'s innocence is how unlike a movie it is . \\ni mean that as the highest compliment . \\nif most studios were to profile an elderly couple who rekindle a 40-year-old romance , i\\'d want to run and hide . \\nthe sex scenes would be handled as a farce , producers would shed 20 years off the characters\\' ages ( so susan sarandon and harrison ford could star ) and true love would shine through any obstacle without explanation and consequence . \\nalong with a charming romantic story , the australian/belgian innocence shows how an increasing sense of mortality combined with revisiting the past while being entrenched in the present can make something that seems so right seem downright questionable . \\nthe romance gets started when former musician andreas ( charles \" bud \" tingwell ) , learns that his true love , claire ( julia blake ) , lives nearby . \\nthey decide to catch up on old times , but soon find themselves in a reinvigorating affair . \\ncomplicating matters is andreas\\' frail health , and claire\\'s longtime husband ( terry norris ) , who can\\'t understand why he\\'s suddenly become obsolete . \\nin my mind , the movie is less about the relationship between andreas and claire , than the feelings of everyone involved . \\njohn , claire\\'s husband , endlessly questions what he did wrong . \\nclaire initially insists she\\'s a grown-up , but admittedly behaves like a child , a prospect that thrills and disappoints her . \\nandreas , an agnostic , begins to question his fate , a message cox delivers in a memorable dream sequence . \\ncox litters the movie with flashbacks , including the repeated vision of a roaring train . \\nit\\'s a reminder of andreas and claire\\'s past love ( as young lovers , they met by train ) , but as it recurs , we get the feeling that the past and the present have clashed . \\na pall is cast on the whole affair . \\na master of the understated , cox strings together a series of memorable moments . \\nin andreas\\' dream sequence , amidst the roar of the train and conversations , we get the whole picture of andreas and claire\\'s love . \\nwe also get glimpses into john and claire\\'s relationship . \\nduring a silent candlelit dinner shortly afterward , claire admits to john about her indiscretion , telling more than any monologue could . \\nall that\\'s heard is the scraping of forks against plates . \\nthe characters are unlike anything i\\'ve seen -- they\\'re people . \\nso many times , movies and especially television portray senior citizens as gratingly spunky . \\nor they\\'re reduced to comedic buffoons . \\nordinary people with a pile of emotions , claire and andreas aren\\'t sure what the next step is . \\nthey do want to be happy , which consists of an entirely different set of conditions than what they\\'ve known throughout their adult lives . \\nbravo to cox , who wrote the script , for not making john a monster , so that claire\\'s affair is automatically justified . \\nnorris is so effective as john that he makes andreas and claire\\'s love difficult to accept . \\nwe feel for him . \\nhe\\'s a decent man . \\nsure , he may have become complacent , but he never expected this , especially now . \\nwith so much presented to the audience , it\\'s only expected that the material gets a little drawn out and repetitive , which it does . \\nhowever , in bringing up tough questions and not offering easy answers , cox displays a skill and ? lan isn\\'t likely to be surpassed by anyone anytime soon . \\n',\n",
       " b'people who enjoy science fiction are often faced with unpleasant surprises due to the improper labelling of novels , stories , comic books or movies . \\noften science fiction aficionados find material , previously labelled as science fiction , to be pure fantasy or supernatural horror , or rather simple techno-thriller . \\nin such cases , mistakes are understandable - genre boundaries are never clearly marked . \\nbut , i believe there are really few cases when a movie labelled as science fiction actually happens to be straight historical epic . \\nsuch thing occurred in former yugoslavia some fifteen years ago , when national distributors gave such treatment to the right stuff , 1983 film directed by philip kaufman . \\nthe mistake of the distributors could be explained with the fact that the official poster of the film features men in space suits . \\nbut the right stuff film isn\\'t even fiction . \\nit was based on the non-fiction book by tom wolfe , covering the early years of american space program . \\nthe plot of the film begins in 1947 when few people heard of edwards air force base , major test site for experimental planes . \\nthe major aim of test flights is to determine ability of manned aircraft to reach 1 mach speed and thus break the sound barrier . \\nmany pilots tried to achieve that goal and many paid with their lives for such bravado . \\nbut one quiet pilot , chuck eager ( played by sam shaped ) succeeds and thus gives example for whole new generation of test pilots , determined to enter history books by breaking new speed records . \\nten years later , soviets have launched \" sputnik \" marking the beginning of the space age . \\nin order to regain national prestige , us government decides to be the first to send man into space . \\nbest air force , navy and marine pilots are recruited into program , but not yeager , because he lacks college education and desired all-american image . \\nin one of critics\\' polls the right stuff was named as one among top 10 films made in 1980s . \\nsuch high position could be explained with the fact that kaufman\\'s film looks quite atypical for its time . \\nwith more than three hours of length and epic scope it looked more suitable for 1950s and 1960s - age when hollywood used to make films larger than life . \\nbut the real reason lies in the fact that it was made by truly remarkable and talented filmmaker . \\nphilip kaufman created reputation in 1970s by using all the opportunities of that golden age in order to create original , memorable movies . \\nthe right stuff was the last of them , swan song of an era when producers allowed directors to spend big bucks on unusual , risk-taking \" artsy \" projects . \\nthe right stuff is unusual because it lacks many standard elements of hollywood film . \\nthe plot is almost non-existent and not very coherent ; the story , featuring many interesting incidents and anecdotes , shifts focus from the old generation of test pilots , embodied in yeager , to new generation of the astronauts . \\nthe film also lacks conventional protagonist - yeager ( who also appears in small cameo ) remains the true hero of the film , but equal time and exposure is also given to other astronauts and their wives , making this movie into ensemble piece . \\nthat gave opportunity for kaufman to use multitude of great acting talents , until that specialised only for bit or character roles . \\nsam shepard is great as yeager , war hero whose greatest achievement - breech of the sound barrier - remained obscured in history books , probably due to his own modesty . \\non the surface , he lacks personality compared with his hyped and more fortunate astronaut colleagues , but shepard gives texture to this character with subtle gestures and phrases . \\nshepard\\'s performance is followed with great acting by ed harris as clean-cut marine ( and future politician ) john glenn . \\nyoung dennis quaid is more than fine as arrogant fighter jock gordo cooper , and this arrogance is mirrored in his friend and most tragic figure of virgil grissom , superbly played by fred ward . \\nalways reliable character actor scott glenn provides some comic relief as navy aviator and ( arguably ) first american man in space alan shepard . \\nkaufman left room for female talents to excel too - barbara hershey , pamela reed , veronica cartwright and mary jo deschanel are great as pilots\\' wives . \\nroyal dano is also impressive as menacing figure of preacher , but the most memorable performances belong to donald moffat as vice-president lyndon b . johnson and jane dornacker as nurse murch . \\ngreat acting talent assembled for this film was mirrored with kaufman\\'s superb direction . \\nmost notable of all is the methods kaufman uses in order to suggest the passage of time . \\nthe beginning of the film shows test pilots living in the middle of desert , as virtual unknowns , far away from strict rules and discipline . \\neverything seems natural -yeager can indulge himself in horse riding just few yards away from the fastest and most precious aircraft in the world . \\nin that setting , it\\'s quite normal for important technical problems to be solved with simple chainsaw and for the test pilots not to report their ribs being broken before most important flights . \\nbut the times are changing ; ww2 alliance with ussr is replaced with cold war , and \" natural \" pilots like yeager must be replaced with more disciplined , conventional pilots . \\ntheir entire lives become focus of media frenzy , and their job is subjected to strict rules , meticulous plans and they must fight the bureaucrats , publicity-seeking politicians and uncaring scientists ( like former nazi rocket expert werner von braun , played by scott beach ) only to preserve their most basic human dignity . \\nthis contrast is underlined with the beautifully edited sequence - while yeager conducts his final and most spectacular test flight in absolute obscurity , \" mercury \" astronauts receive fame and fortune , although some of them even before going in the space . \\nthose contrasts and similar effects are achieved with kaufman\\'s superb use of poetic movie language . \\nediting is great , and photography by caleb deschanel provides many memorable scenes like the funeral in the desert or astronauts in their suits walking in slow motion ( the same image would be copied in many latter films ) . \\nalthough kaufman enjoyed support of nasa and american military , which provided authentic locations and period equipment , he still had to use special effects in order to simulate space flights . \\nthose effects are excellent and they can still fool the audience accustomed to cgi and real footage of earth from outer space . \\nanother fine contribution of this film is \" oscar \" -awarded musical score by bill conti ; i still tremble from excitement every time i hear it . \\nit is accompanied with the use of holst and debussy . \\nsome of the songs used in the background also provide authentic atmosphere of the historical period . \\nthis film is great , and its cult status is well deserved , but there are some minor flaws . \\nsome of the \" mercury \" astronauts aren\\'t fleshed out enough ( although being played by fine actors , like lance henriksen ) . \\nfilm also lacks proper closure . \\non the other hand , most logical conclusion of the film - landing on the moon - would require this film to be more than six hours long . \\nalso , some critics were prone to attack this film as too amerocentric and hard on russians , who were portrayed as evil monsters , just in line with most virulent cold war rhetoric of reagan\\'s america . \\nin some of contemporary interviews , kaufman defended that approach by claiming that he wanted to make film as authentic as possible , and in order to do that , he portrayed russians not as they were in real life , but as they were perceived by americans in early 1960s . \\ntime has passed ; now we don\\'t see astronauts as heroes . \\nin this age of widespread satellite communications and routine space missions , those men and women in space suits are seen as mere maintenance workers . \\nfew young boys want to be astronauts when they grow up . \\nbut this film , sentimental reminder of the times \" when future began \" , perhaps could encourage at least some of them to follow \" mercury \" astronauts\\' footsteps seek new frontiers in the sky . \\nand even if they decide to stay on earth , they could still appreciate the right stuff as an extraordinary piece of cinema . \\n',\n",
       " b' \" snake eyes \" is the most aggravating kind of movie : the kind that shows so much potential then becomes unbelievably disappointing . \\nit\\'s not just because this is a brian depalma film , and since he\\'s a great director and one who\\'s films are always greeted with at least some fanfare . \\nand it\\'s not even because this was a film starring nicolas cage and since he gives a brauvara performance , this film is hardly worth his talents . \\nit\\'s worse than that . \\nit\\'s aggravating for the sole reason that its story could be so much more , could be totally intelligent , and it opens up with absolutely no subtlety that it will be handled complexly and intensely . . . then at one point in the movie makes on wrong turn that leads it to the hall of fame of half-assedness . \\nor more deservedly , the hall of fame of the eighth-assedness . \\nin certain circles , \" snake eyes \" was being advertised as a kind of modern day version of kurosawa\\'s classic \" rashomon , \" where a crime is told from the four different ( and i mean different ) perspectives , and it looks as though it may actually be just like this with the opening , which , i might add , is superb . \\nin one very very very long steadicam shot , we meet the protagonist , crooked atlantic city detective , rick santoro ( cage ) , and follow him before a boxing match as he talks on his cell phone with his wife , interupts a pay-per-view event on tv , chases down a gambler , enters the arena all pumped up for the fight , sits down and talks with his bud , kevin dunne ( gary sinise , who\\'s character should not be confused with that of actor kevin dunn , who\\'s also in this ) , and watches as it happens . \\nthere\\'s a big name in the crowd , and that\\'s the secretary of defense , charles kirkland ( joel fabiani ) , who\\'s sitting behind rick , and who gets shot a second after the heavyweight champion , lincoln tyler ( stan shaw ) , is knocked out . \\nthis all happens in the opening shot , and it creates so many red herrings and possibilities of what happened that it opens this scene up for close examination and total deconstruction . \\nwhat really happened , this film asks , and it sets this film up extremely well for when rick begins to question people and get different perspectives on the scene . . . and \\ndiscovers there\\'s a very good possibility it was a conspiracy . \\nas we follow rick trying to learn of more information , we also meet a woman who was talking to kirkland before he was shot ( carla gugino ) , and who flees the scene in a panic , and tries to hide from the cops in the arena and the adjacent casino/hotel since the cops have blocked off the doors so they can get witness\\' takes on what happened . \\nthis is all going pretty fine and dandy , and it\\'s extremely interesting to watch . . . then \\nit takes one wrong step . \\nwe follow the wrong character , and we learn of the answer to the mystery too early on , and way before rick can find it out . \\nbut that\\'s not the worst part of it : it\\'s that it\\'s the one person you didn\\'t think it would be because he was too obviously supposed to be the red herring , the one you didn\\'t think did it because it would be stupid and cliched of that person to be behind it . \\nit only gets worse : the film turns into a chase film about half way through the film , and since we already know what happened , we can\\'t rely on rick\\'s investigation to be all that interesting . \\nit\\'s as if the film ran out of the guts to be really complex and original about a third of the way in , and decided to just fall back on an easy way out , and that just happens to mean that it has to become less and less credible . \\nevents become more and more proposterous , and by the end , the film has decided to rely on the worst offender in mysteries like this : the deux ex machina . \\nthat\\'s where some outside intereference brings the film to a sudden conclusion and makes everything okay . \\nthis time , it\\'s a hurricane , an out-of-control police car , and a big round ball that adorned the arena . \\nwhat went wrong ? \\ndepalma and the screenwriter , david koepp , are extremely credible people in their respective fields , and have been known for bringing life and complexity to mysteries such as this . \\ndepalma , who idolizes hitchcock to death , has done many a film like this , such as his masterpiece , \" blow out , \" where a movie soundman uses movie elements to uncover a conspiracy piece by piece . \\nbut granted , depalma at least makes it intriguing to watch , what with his over-the-top shot set-ups , notably the beginning and a sequence where the camera pans over top of a bunch of rooms in the hotel , forgetting anything about boundaries . \\nat least his direction makes up partly for it . \\nthen there\\'s koepp , who showed such great ability at making a character\\'s flaws come to life like he did in depalma\\'s earlier \" carlito\\'s way , \" a film that dove right into the life and past of its character and examined him extremely well . \\nhe can write a flawed character , but his rick santoro seems to be just a half-assed effort . \\nhe\\'s flawed , and we can see redemption if the story wasn\\'t so formulaic . \\na scene towards the end where he has to make a fatal decision is cheapened by the fact that his answer has no emotional buildup . \\nhe may as well have said the opposite of what he says ; it would have at least gone with what the character was like . \\nthis is the most disappointing kind of film because it promises intelligence and complexity , because it promises disection of a flawed character and perhaps even redemption , then pulls the rug from under us just as we were about to be convinced it would be able to go all the way . \\nas i was watching the first half hour , i couldn\\'t wait to see how the mystery would be unearthed , how many different perspectives he\\'d be given , and perhaps he\\'d have to make a choice between who\\'s he has to believe . \\nnow there\\'s a film . \\nunfortunately , the film has two major deux ex machinas : one in the disasterous ending ; the other , about a half hour in when the film goes into autopilot and becomes a stale and recycled piece of crap we\\'ve seen all too much before , but never from someone like depalma . \\n',\n",
       " b'bruce willis and sixth sense director m . night shyamalan re-team to tell the story of david dunne ( willis ) , a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child . \\non a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job , dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of . \\nto make things even stranger , dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed . \\na comic book art dealer named elijah price ( samuel l . jackson ) , who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly , has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life . \\nprice felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him . . . \\nsomeone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break . \\nprice contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child . \\ndunne doesn\\'t believe him at first , but price assists him in discovering his \" powers \" and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is . \\nwriter/director m . night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense . \\nhow exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years ? \\nfor shyamalan , the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners . \\ndoes this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash , though ? \\nthe answer to that question is not a very easy one , either . \\nas far as pacing goes , the sixth sense seemed almost interminable . \\nit wasn\\'t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally ( and perfectly ) paced in order to give the audience ample time to re-connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached . \\nfor unbreakable , shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which , in many ways , blows away the film that had come before . \\nthe story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan\\'s direction is excellent , with the camera almost constantly moving . \\nthere are tons of great shots in the film , not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis\\' character and another train passenger . \\nthe shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak . \\nalso very impressive is the film\\'s score by james newton howard ( who also scored shyamalan\\'s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes , as well as this year\\'s dinosaur ) . \\nseveral of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film . \\none of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to \" exercise \" his powers . \\nthe music , in combination with the stellar visuals , really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie . \\nif there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year , this one would be it . \\nthe film also boasts some great performances , including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment . \\nwillis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne , who just can\\'t seem to figure out why he\\'s been depressed for the last few years . \\nhis character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him , but he eventually grows into his own under elijah\\'s tutelage . \\njackson is one of the better actors of our time , and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah . \\nthough his hairstyle is absurd , jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked . \\nrobin wright penn\\'s role seems slightly underwritten , but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character\\'s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again . \\nspencer treat clark , as the dunne\\'s young son jeremy , shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors , and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film . \\nout of all the characters , jeremy\\'s is perhaps the most emotional , and clark does a great job with the role . \\nwhere the film does lose points though , is during its \" surprise \" ending . \\nshyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense , but i found myself saying \" that was it ? ! \" \\nwhen unbreakable revealed its own ending . \\nit\\'s not that the ending is bad , it\\'s just that the ending doesn\\'t quite have the emotional punch that the other film\\'s did . \\nplus , it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels ( and i won\\'t reveal the ending here , but you\\'ll understand what i mean when you see it ) . \\nessentially , what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable . \\nthe only real problem is that the ending doesn\\'t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor . \\nas long as it isn\\'t held to the standard that sixth sense set ( which it ultimately will be ) , it should be a remarkably well liked film . \\none thing seems clear , though . \\nshyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film . \\n',\n",

\\nwow . \\nreflection is the biggest killer for this film . \\ntheir apartment and almost everything in the film casts reflections and the crew can be seen in these , some quite glaringly . \\none more topic of heated discussion : i saw the \" austin powers \" version , and to be perfectly frank , unless you know where the overlays are supposed to be , you\\'ll probably not see them . \\ntwo girls standing next to each other look a little suspicious , but i can wait for the unrated version on video to see it the way it\\'s supposed to be . \\nspoilers below : \\nthe film itself starts with ( cruise ) bill and ( kidman ) alice getting ready for a little x-mas soiree . \\nthey go to a quite elegant party in what seems to be a storagehouse for lighting equipment , which is actually an apartment owned by pollack . \\nbill runs into an old friend from medical school who is now the party\\'s entertainment . \\nsoon after , bill and alice are flirting with others at the party , thinking that the other has not noticed . \\nbill is called to help with a partygoer who has had a bit too much of a good time . \\nthe next day , bill and alice , casually smoking marijunana in their bedroom discuss the previous nights flirtations . \\nthey both discover that they both knew about the flirting . \\nbill starts talking about what women can provide in a relationship , and gets alice extremely angry . \\nin her hazy state , she tells of an opportunity she almost acted on to cheat on bill , not caring about the possible aftereffects . \\nbill gets called away when one of his patients dies , and goes to console his daughter . \\nwhen his patient\\'s engaged daughter makes a plea for his love and affection , he is struck with images of an affair that never occured between his wife , alice and a naval officer . \\nhe sees \" opportunity \" as a betrayal to his wife , and before they can continue , they are interrupted . \\nas he strolls home , he encounters a hooker . \\nseeing another \" opportunity \" arise , he follows the hooker home . \\nthey toy around , but before the act ensues , alice calls his cell phone . \\nhe breaks the date with the hooker , and heads back out into the night . \\nhe passes a lounge and notices that his old medical school buddy is playing , so he heads in . \\nwhen he meets the friend , the friend reveals that for extra scratch , he plays these strange parties , while blindfolded . \\nbill is intrigued and wants to go to one . \\nnick reluctantly sets him up with directions and a password . \\nwhat follows this is a short meeting where bill obtains a costume for this party and meets a young girl , leelee sobieski , and her father . \\nthe young girl has drawn his eye , but her young age , and the prescence of her father deter this from happening . \\nhe gets to the party , which is to say the least , a strange affair . \\nafter partaking in some strange \" religious \" right , women and men pair off for the orgy to end all orgies . \\na woman warns bill in disguise , that he should leave before he is exposed as a fraud at the party . \\nhe is detained after a second warning , where he is outed for not being in the group . \\nafter getting home , he hides the evidence of his evenings events . \\nunable to carry on in his day , he tries piece the events of the previous night together . \\nin the process , he finds that nick has disappeared , his life is possibly in danger , and the woman that warned him has died . \\ni\\'m trying to save a bit of the film here , it\\'s worth sitting through to get to this point . \\nthis is only about 100 minutes at this point . \\nthis is a strange film , because despite the events that occur , the film has a strong family message behind it . \\nit will be hard to pidgeonhole this film as a certain kind of a film . \\nit\\'s got sex in it , it has nudity , drugs , and many more immoralistic values . \\nbut they all serve to show why they are bad in one\\'s life . \\ni recommend this film highly on many merits . \\ncruise and kidman are rarely together for longer than 5 minutes after the opening scene , and the secrecy that shrouded the film should hopefully be apparent as to why it was kept once you see it for yourself . \\n',\n",
       " b'a cinematic version of one of john irving\\'s novels is always cause for celebration even if , as in the case of \" simon birch , \" the treatment is merely \" suggested by , \" rather than strictly based on , the book . \\nsuggested means that irving , author of the acclaimed \" the world according to garp , \" sold the rights to his novel \" a prayer for owen meany \" to the disney machine for $1 million , but wouldn\\'t grant them permission to use either the title or any of the character names . \\nthat\\'s an odd decision--irving claims it\\'s to protect both himself and the novel--but it\\'s one that doesn\\'t unduly harm the finished product . \\nirving\\'s books are rich and complex works , full of intriguing , colorful characters . \\n \" a prayer for owen meany \" is no exception ; it tells the story of an unusual boy--called simon birch in the film version--who is uncommonly small in stature and possesses a high-pitched falsetto voice , \" like strangled mice . \" \\nsimon believes himself to be \" god\\'s instrument , \" placed on this earth to somehow effect god\\'s plan . \\nsimon is played by ian michael smith , who suffers from a rare enzyme disorder known as morquio syndrome which , among other things , prevents bones , ligaments , and joints from developing normally . \\nsmith\\'s debilitating disease makes him an obvious physical choice for \" simon birch \" ; however , the producers unwisely favored form over function--smith\\'s acting abilities are limited at best . \\nanother drawback is that in the book , simon\\'s condition is described the way irving describes any of his characters--in careful , loving detail . \\nwatching \" simon birch , \" however , creates a different feeling altogether ; the audience is forced into a voyeuristic relationship with the character , surely something irving would not have intended . \\nsimon himself tends to be too cute and irritating , a combination of smith\\'s rookie status as an actor and the precocious one-liners he\\'s forced to deliver , courtesy mark steven johnson , the film\\'s director and screenwriter . \\nfortunately , simon birch isn\\'t the real star of the film that bears his name . \\nsimon is more of a catalyst , allowing his co-stars to shape the story , and the actors who fill those roles to turn in outstanding supporting performances , saving the film from an obsequious , manipulative destiny . \\nfirst and foremost is joseph mazzello ( \" jurassic park \" ) , who is nothing less than remarkable as simon\\'s best friend , joe . \\nmazzello turns in a wonderfully layered performance for a 14 year old , ripe with laughter , pain , and tears ; he is certainly an emerging talent . \\nashley judd positively beams in her role as rebecca , joe\\'s single mother , and oliver platt is warm and tender as her boyfriend , ben . \\ndavid strathairn and jan hooks play the town\\'s reverend and sunday school teacher respectively and their contributions uphold the high standards set by the others . \\nthere\\'s even a surprising yet effective uncredited cameo performance from . . . \\nwell , that would be telling . \\nperhaps \" suggested by \" the novel is the appropriate way to go after all , since \" simon birch \" only focuses on one chapter , one year , of simon\\'s extraordinary life . \\nthe film also changes the book\\'s ending to one that is more melodramatic , yet necessary given simon\\'s lot . \\nthe flavor of irving\\'s original novel remains , however--the passions , friendships , and insecurities that come with a change of seasons to the little community of gravestown , maine , and the engaging oddballs , both big and small , who reside there . \\n',\n",
